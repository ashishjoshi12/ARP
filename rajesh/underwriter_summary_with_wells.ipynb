Report\n","CEO Letter \n","Dear Shareholders: \n","2023 was a year of continued progress for Wells Fargo. We delivered stronger financial performance versus 2022 and we \n","continued to execute on our strategic priorities. Our results benefited from the strong economic environment, higher interest \n","rates, our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline. In addition, we are just beginning to see the impacts of \n","investments we’ve made to better serve our customers and grow more quickly. \n","We are moving forward with our risk and control work, and we are investing to build a faster-growing and a higher-returning \n","company, while we in parallel work to become more efficient. We effectively managed through an uncertain economic \n","environment in 2023 and a period of stress for certain banks. Our franchise allowed us, along with other large banks, to be a \n","source of strength for the U.S. economy during an unsettled period. All in all, I feel very good about what we accomplished in 2023 \n","and continue to be optimistic as we look forward. \n","Financial performance \n","In 2023, Wells Fargo generated $19.1 billion in net income, or $4.83 per diluted common share. We grew net income and diluted \n","earnings per share from a year ago, with higher revenue and lower expenses. \n","Our revenue increased 11% from the previous year. The higher rate environment drove strong growth in net interest income, \n","which was up 17% from a year ago. We also grew noninterest income, with strong growth in trading activities, investment banking \n","fees, and commissions and brokerage service fees, reflecting market conditions as well as the investments we’ve been making in \n","our wholesale businesses. This growth was partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking, primarily driven by our efforts to \n","simplify the home lending business, as well as lower deposit-related fees, reflecting our efforts to help customers avoid overdraft \n","fees.  \n","Expenses declined 3% from a year ago and included the impact of our efficiency initiatives, which have resulted in $10 billion of \n","gross saves over the past three years. We reduced expenses even as we incurred a $1.9 billion FDIC special assessment as a result \n","of regional bank failures early in 2023, in addition to higher severance expense, as we continued our focus on efficiency. \n","Additionally, we continued to make investments in our risk and control infrastructure and in strategic initiatives across our \n","businesses. I go into more detail on these efforts later in this letter. \n","As expected, net loan charge-offs increased from historically low levels.  We continue to closely monitor our portfolios, taking \n","credit tightening actions as appropriate. While we’ve seen credit quality deteriorate modestly, it has remained within our \n","expectations. \n","We increased our allowance for credit losses throughout the year. The change was driven by our expectations for potential losses \n","in parts of our loan portfolio, due to both changes in balances as well as our expectations for higher losses, especially in office \n","loans. As of year-end, we had approximately 11% reserved for our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) office exposure in our Corporate \n","and Investment Banking (CIB) business. As expected, losses started to materialize in our CRE office portfolio during 2023 as \n","market fundamentals remained weak. We will continue to monitor for potential losses going forward and adjust our allowance \n","accordingly. \n","Average loans outstanding increased by 2% from a year ago, with growth in the first half of the year offsetting declines later in the \n","year, reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credit-tightening actions.  Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by consumer \n","spending as well as customers continuing to migrate to higher-yielding alternatives in a rising rate environment. \n","Our capital levels remained strong while we continued to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders, including \n","increasing our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share, and we repurchased $12 billion of \n","common stock. \n","Our return on equity was 11.0%, and our return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 13.1%.1 \n","2023 economic events \n","2023 was a year of uncertain economic outcomes as high inflation caused the Federal Reserve to aggressively increase interest \n","rates while pursuing a policy of quantitative tightening. There was much talk throughout the year about whether these actions \n","1 Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, including a corresponding \n","reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the \"Financial Review - Capital Management - Tangible Common Equity\" section in this Report. \n","  2023 Annual Report      i \n","would put the economy in a recession or result in a soft landing. So far the result has been a slowing economy in an orderly \n","fashion, and the risks of a meaningful recession are diminishing. \n","We took several proactive steps to prepare for the uncertain economic outcome. While we have continued to provide credit \n","broadly, we have been actively managing credit exposure. This is important not only from a risk-management standpoint; it also \n","helps us do the right thing for our customers by extending credit based on conservative underwriting standards. Across both \n","wholesale and consumer segments, those that are on the margin are more at risk, and we have worked to identify stress early to \n","minimize negative outcomes for our customers and losses for us. Specifically: \n","• \n","In CRE, we continue to actively work to de-risk and reduce our office exposure.  Our CRE team has a rigorous monitoring \n","process, has issued additional underwriting guidance, and has implemented escalated review and approval requirements.  \n","• \n","On the consumer side, we began taking credit tightening actions in 2022, which included increasing credit score minimums \n","across our products. Over the past several years, we have launched several new credit cards, which has resulted in strong \n","new account growth and an increase in loans outstanding. The credit quality of our new accounts has remained strong and \n","initial vintage performance has been consistent with our expectations.  \n","• \n","Credit losses in our home lending portfolio remained near zero last year, but as higher home prices and interest rates have \n","raised home affordability concerns, we have taken actions, including reducing loan-to-value maximums in certain \n","geographies.  \n","• \n","The size of our auto portfolio continued to decline throughout the year as we increased minimum credit scores and \n","reduced loan-to-value and debt ratio maximums.  \n","In addition to taking these actions, we worked proactively to manage our interest risk and liquidity exposure. Banks such as ours \n","have large securities portfolios driven by the fact that we have more deposits than loans. We invest some of the difference in \n","securities and earn a market yield.  This portfolio, combined with the other assets and liabilities we hold, creates risk that should \n","be managed very carefully. We invested prudently when yields were low. By doing this, we forwent additional net interest income \n","in the short term, but we avoided outsized losses in our securities portfolio as rates rose. Ultimately, we have started to invest at \n","higher rates.  \n","Managing this trade-off is critical for banks as we rely on the confidence of both our customers and the markets to operate. \n","Managing our liquidity and capital is extremely important to supporting that confidence. That, in combination with a strong \n","balance sheet and diversified business model, helped us in 2023. \n","Regional bank crisis \n","Each winter when I write this letter, I review events of the prior year that distinguish it from others. There are always surprises \n","that are either economically or market driven. Our goal is to be prepared for the unknowns, which means being financially strong, \n","strategically well positioned, and having the operational and management capabilities to not just survive, but to be a source of \n","strength.  \n","We have a diversified business model, a strong balance sheet, and growing margins. Our management team is extremely capable \n","and has proven their capabilities over the past several years. The work we have done together has bolstered our position even \n","more.  \n","We believe our business model provides unique benefits that allow us to serve customers, communities and the broader economy \n","in important and differentiated ways. We are predominantly a U.S. bank, and we have scale and diversification across the country. \n","We serve a broad range of customers, from large to small and across numerous industries and wealth segments. We have a \n","diversified set of risks that we actively manage, and we seek to avoid concentrations that could be outsized for our company. Our \n","funding sources are diversified, we have a strong capital base, and as one of eight Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) in \n","the U.S., we operate with heightened regulation and supervision. This enhances our strength. \n","When there are disruptive events, the benefits of our business model become even clearer. In the first quarter of 2023, we were \n","able to support the U.S. financial system, along with ten other large banks, by utilizing our strength and liquidity to make a $5 \n","billion uninsured deposit into First Republic. This deposit helped First Republic provide liquidity to its customers and calm the \n","markets for a period of time.  \n","We were well prepared for this scenario and were viewed as a safe institution to serve customers during this period.  Our \n","customers and ultimately our communities benefit from this stability. \n","ii\n","  2023 Annual Report      iii \n","Our transformation \n","We have made significant progress in transforming Wells Fargo. We are executing on our risk and control work, we have \n","reoriented our business priorities, we have changed how we manage the company, and we have improved how we work across our \n","business. \n","2023 was an important year in our transformation. When I began as CEO of Wells Fargo in 2019, we set out a series of strategic \n","priorities, and in 2023 we continued to execute them. \n","Risk and control \n","I have been clear since I joined the company that closing gaps in Wells Fargo’s risk and control environment is our top priority. \n","Simply stated, the objective is to build a risk and control infrastructure that is appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity, \n","making our operational and compliance risk management as robust as our credit and other financial risk management has \n","historically been. \n","To get this work done, we have developed plans and have been executing them now for several years. We are completing these \n","plans with increasing confidence. We have detailed project plans that track interim deliverables, not just the dates when the work \n","is to be finalized and turned over to our regulators for validation. As we have completed these interim deliverables, our control \n","environment has become increasingly stronger. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous, ongoing effort, and as we \n","implement changes, we track effectiveness along the way. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly \n","improving our control environment – but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. \n","We are making progress because we are managing this work differently than we did historically.  We have prioritized it as the \n","most important body of work we have to accomplish at the company. We have much more effective reporting and processes in \n","place to provide appropriate oversight. We have added approximately 10,000 people across numerous risk- and control-related \n","groups and spent over $2.5 billion more in 2023 than in 2018 in these areas. Critical to our progress is the experienced people we \n","now have at the company who have the skills and commitment to complete this work.  \n","In February 2024, we reached an important milestone when the OCC announced the termination of a consent order it issued in \n","2016 regarding sales practices misconduct at the company. Since the order was put in place in 2016, we have revamped how we \n","offer and sell products and services and we have taken additional actions to protect our customers and employees. \n","The closure of this order is an important step forward and is a demonstration of what I wrote above: we have prioritized risk- and \n","control-related work, we have put substantial resources behind it, and we are seeing results. The OCC’s action is confirmation that \n","we operate much differently today around sales practices, and it is the sixth enforcement action against Wells Fargo that our \n","regulators have closed since 2019. \n","This is not to say that we are done. We remain focused on the work ahead and, again, we are moving forward with confidence. At \n","the same time, I will repeat what I’ve said in the past. Regulatory pressure on banks with longstanding issues such as ours is high \n","and until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. \n","Additionally, as we implement heightened controls and oversight, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these \n","may result in additional regulatory actions. \n","Reorienting our business mix and building higher returns through cycles \n","We continue to look at our business mix and react to changes in regulations, market dynamics and the external environment to \n","put us in a strong position to serve our customers.  We are also working more closely across the company’s business units and \n","functions than ever before. \n","Repositioning Home Lending \n","Over the past year, we have implemented a meaningfully different Home Lending business model than we had been \n","operating for decades. We made the decision to significantly downsize the business and focus on serving customers who \n","have a broader relationship with Wells Fargo, while continuing to provide support for underserved communities. \n","In some ways this decision was hard; in other ways it was easy. Having a large home lending platform had been an \n","important part of what defined Wells Fargo for a long time. We prided ourselves on helping build home ownership across \n","the United States. And for many years, the origination revenues generally increased when rates decreased, providing \n","much-needed diversification from many of the company’s other businesses, which generally earned less in lower-rate \n","environments. \n","iv\n","Our decision reflects our belief that much has changed regarding regulation, capital requirements, and reputational risk \n","for large banks who operate large home lending businesses, as well as the different standards in this space for smaller \n","banks and non-banks. Simply put, we do not believe the risk-adjusted returns and the reputation risk we bear are \n","attractive to operate the business at the scale we did previously.  \n","We still view home lending as an important product to offer our customers and we will continue to support their needs. \n","We can do this with a smaller business than we have had in the past. \n","Since we announced this change, we have exited the correspondent lending business and reduced the size of our sales \n","force. Since 2019, Wells Fargo’s home lending originations have decreased from $204 billion to $25 billion, and the \n","amount of mortgage loans we service for third parties declined by over 45%. \n","Other business simplification \n","In addition to executing on our more focused home lending strategy, we continue to look at other activities with an aim \n","toward simplifying the company. To that end, we sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain \n","Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds in 2023. \n","Our actions in 2023 to simplify the company build on other actions we took between 2019-2022. These include the \n","following: \n","• \n","Sold Wells Fargo Asset Management \n","• \n","Sold our Corporate Trust Services business \n","• \n","Sold our student lending portfolio and stopped the origination of new student loans \n","• \n","Exited our international wealth management segment \n","• \n","Sold our Canadian direct equipment finance business \n","• \n","Exited the direct Auto business \n","• \n","Stopped originating personal lines of credit \n","• \n","Sold our Institutional Retirement and Trust business \n","• \n","In addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better \n","focus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and \n","elsewhere. \n","Investing in our core businesses to better serve customers \n","We are investing more aggressively than in the past in parts of our business to better serve our customers and we \n","believe these will help produce higher risk adjusted returns over economic cycles. \n","Credit Card \n","We continue to believe that a broader credit card platform is important strategically for the company. Providing \n","credit for our customers is a core strategy for us, but being involved in payments has grown in importance. Though \n","our card business is smaller than some of our competitors, it operates with necessary scale and we have been \n","working to introduce attractive new products over the last few years. These include Active Cash®, which offers \n","customers 2% cash rewards on purchases with no limits and no annual fees; Autograph℠, which offers three-times \n","points on certain purchases; Reflect®, which offers 0% intro APR for 21 months; and, most recently, new co-branded \n","cards with Choice Hotels. \n","In total, spend on our cards grew by 15% between 2022-2023, significantly more than the industry average; our \n","credit card balances grew 13%; and credit quality remains within our expectations.  \n","These products have been well received in the marketplace because they offer clear and simple customer value \n","propositions. That’s something we’ll continue to focus on as we build our Cards business, while we also work to \n","improve our fraud capabilities, line assignments, and customer service. \n","I’m proud of the progress we’ve made and am excited about what is still to come.  \n","  2023 Annual Report      v \n","Corporate and Investment Bank \n","We are investing to build our fee-based businesses in our Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB). While historically \n","many outside of Wells Fargo have not perceived us as a bank that serves large corporate clients, in fact we have \n","relationships with approximately three-quarters of the Fortune 500. We are a significant lender and provide cash \n","management solutions for many. We have also built out our capabilities to help clients access the public markets \n","and ranked fourth in high-grade bond underwriting in 2023.2 \n","Our investments in CIB are logical extensions of what we currently do for our existing client base. They have \n","positioned us to increase our fee-based revenues with clients where we already provide significant credit, and to \n","increase our returns overall. In 2023, for example, we leveraged our leading commercial real estate franchise into a \n","number-one position in real estate investment banking.3 Importantly, feedback from our clients has been extremely \n","positive.  \n","Our investments in CIB have been disciplined, and the work has been guided by a targeted plan against certain \n","industries and product capabilities. More than 50 new senior hires have joined CIB since 2019, with many of these in \n","key coverage and product groups within Banking. We have had a particular focus in high-growth sectors, including \n","technology, media and telecommunications, as well as health care, sponsors, mergers and acquisitions, and equity \n","capital markets. \n","While it is early, the results are quite encouraging. For example, our M&A announced-volume market share and rank \n","have gone from 2.9% and number 19 in 2019 to 9.9% and number 8 in 20234. Our M&A fee market share and rank \n","have gone from 1.6% and number 20 in 2019 to 2.0% and number 14 in 2023.5 We have led numerous significant \n","transactions over the past two years. And Wells Fargo’s overall investment banking share has moved up two ranks in \n","the U.S. since 2019, from number 8 to number 6, with 3.7% share.6 \n","We are also investing in our trading activities, with a focus on technology and serving our institutional client base. \n","We have enhanced our electronic trading platform by  upgrading quantitative hedging methods and trading \n","algorithms, expanding product offerings, and improving platform scalability. Expanded technology offerings also \n","attracted more clients to our foreign exchange (FX) platform, and our FX market share ended the year at #4, with \n","5.4% share.7  Investments in Equity Research have also resulted in improvements in our 2023 Institutional Investor \n","All American Research Ranking; we achieved a #7 (tie) rank, up 3 spots from the prior year.8 Overall Markets \n","achieved a #6 rank in the Americas.9 \n","Commercial Bank \n","We are a leader in U.S. middle-market banking and we are focused on finding ways to provide additional support for \n","clients. In 2023, we announced that we had entered into a strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners, \n","focused on direct lending to non-sponsor North American middle-market companies. Centerbridge has since \n","launched Overland Advisors to manage a newly formed business development company that will be primarily \n","focused on making senior secured loans, and Wells Fargo can refer clients to Overland Advisors for evaluation of \n","possible alternative financing options. \n","Providing our middle-market clients with greater access to capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of \n","growth and value creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions should be an important differentiator. It \n","will help strengthen our client relationships while adding fee-based revenue to Wells Fargo.                 \n","2 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","3 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","4 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","5 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","6 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","7 Source: Coalition Greenwich Competitor Analytics – Americas FY23.

We have revamped how we offer and sell products; we have put in \n","place new systems, processes, and controls across the retail bank; and we have established stronger oversight. \n","In parallel to these risk- and control-focused changes, we have worked to build the foundation to grow our business \n","and improve the customer experience both digitally and in our branches.  \n","Digital \n","We continued to enhance our consumer banking mobile app in 2023, which is driving mobile adoption \n","momentum. We added 1.6 million mobile active customers in 2023 and increased mobile logins 11% from \n","a year ago.  \n","We introduced FargoTM, our new AI-powered virtual assistant, in April of last year, and in the third quarter \n","we expanded its capabilities to allow customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish. Consumers \n","interacted over 21 million times last year with Fargo. \n","We expect our digital interactions to grow further this year, as we continue to help our customers utilize \n","banking services in a quicker, more accessible way than they have in the past. \n","Branch network \n","Wells Fargo has one of the largest branch networks in the nation, with over 4,000 locations across the \n","country. We operate branches in 24 of the 30 largest markets, we cover more rural markets than many \n","large banks, and nearly 30% of our branches are in low- or moderate-income U.S. Census tracts. \n","As our customers continue to shift to digital channels, we reduced our total number of branches by over \n","280, or 6%, from a year ago, but that does not mean we are moving away from branches. In fact, it’s the \n","opposite. Branches remain critical to the work we do as a company. To that end: \n","• \n","We are refurbishing our existing branches as part of an accelerated multi-year effort to transform \n","and refresh our branch network. \n","• \n","We are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches, creating a fast and easy \n","experience for our customers. \n","• \n","We are investing in new branches. In October 2023, for example, we announced that we are \n","growing our retail branch footprint in Chicago from seven to at least 30 branches in the coming \n","years. \n","• \n","We are expanding Wells Fargo Premier, which provides tailored services to clients with high \n","qualifying balances.  \n","Other products and services \n","vi\n","We continue to look for ways to support our customers with our products, features and services. \n","We rolled out Early Pay Day in 2022, which makes eligible direct deposits available to customers up to two \n","days early, with no fee. In 2023, this enhancement provided customers early access to over $800 billion in \n","direct deposits. \n","We’ve introduced Extra Day Grace, which gives customers an extra business day to make deposits and \n","avoid overdraft fees. It benefitted over 5 million customers in 2023, helping them avoid over $750 million \n","in overdraft fees.  \n","In the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Flex Loan, a digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible \n","customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Customer response continues to exceed our \n","expectations, and we originated over 350,000 loans last year. \n","Wealth and Investment Management \n","When I arrived at Wells Fargo in 2019, it was clear that our Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) business \n","had significant opportunity to grow, and, today, it is on the right path. \n","  2023 Annual Report      vii \n","In 2023, attrition remained low and we continued our focus of hiring experienced advisors across our multi-channel \n","offering – a differentiator for the business. We offer a traditional wirehouse option for advisors; a bank-based \n","channel which allows customers in our nationwide bank branches to forge a relationship with an advisor; and \n","independent channels comprised of Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network and First Clearing, our clearing and \n","custody services for broker-dealers and registered investment advisors. \n","As we expand the ranks of our financial advisors, we continue to invest in the business. In 2023, we expanded client \n","access to high-yield products. We modernized our advisor platform, making it easier for our financial advisors to \n","serve their clients. And we continue to focus on digital enhancements. One example is Stock Fractions, giving \n","WellsTrade® clients the ability to buy fractions of a company’s stock to help build a diversified portfolio, regardless \n","of stock price. \n","Investing in infrastructure \n","Technology is a key driver of progress across our businesses. We have built new capabilities with more modern \n","technologies over the past several years – and these will benefit our wholesale and consumer customers as well as our \n","employees. Examples include: \n","• \n","Modernization of our core banking systems, with a new pricing platform and customer information management \n","system \n","• \n","Continued work to digitize lending origination and servicing platforms for Small Business, Commercial Banking, \n","and CIB clients \n","• \n","Enabling the modernization and advancement of the enterprise-wide, global payments capabilities creating \n","optimized flow of payments, improving operational efficiency, and preparing for potential changes in the market \n","• \n","Working to launch VantageSM, our new digital channel for Commercial Banking and CIB clients to perform real-\n","time payments, automated clearing house, lending servicing, and FX transactions \n","• \n","Refreshing our auto-lending decisioning platform \n","• \n","Building modern data centers and executing on our hybrid cloud strategy to enable business agility and \n","efficiencies \n","• \n","Modernizing our software development processes \n","Increasing efficiency \n","We continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives, including bringing down headcount every quarter since the \n","third quarter of 2020 and, as noted above, meaningfully reducing the number of retail bank branches as we’ve steadily \n","improved our digital offerings. We also benefitted from contract efficiencies and infrastructure optimization in our \n","Technology group. We continue to believe opportunities exist for ongoing efficiency improvements. \n","More on changes over the past five years \n","The above sections paint a picture of progress we’ve made on numerous fronts over the past several years. In this section I want \n","to take a step back and look at some data that quantifies our progress broadly. \n","When I arrived at the company in 2019, two things were clear. \n","One, we had to preserve much of what made Wells Fargo such a great place historically: the dedication of our employees, the \n","company’s longstanding commitment to our communities, and the ability to serve our customers on a highly local basis. Wells \n","Fargo’s presence in local communities has always been and continues to be a differentiator for us. \n","Two, while we had to preserve all of this, we also had to make substantial changes to the way we operate. Five years later, we have \n","done so: \n","• \n","We are a simpler company, both in terms of the businesses we have exited and the size of our employee base, which has \n","shrunk by approximately 50,000, or approximately 18%, since second quarter 2020. This has occurred even as we have \n","added approximately 10,000 employees across numerous risk- and control-related groups since 2018. \n","• \n","We are a more efficient company. Our noninterest expense has declined by over 4% since 2019. This progress comes even \n","as we have continued to invest in our risk and control infrastructure – again, with $2.5 billion more in 2023 compared with \n","2018 – as well as in significant strategic initiatives across our businesses. \n","• \n","We are a more valuable company from a shareholder perspective. Book value per common share is up approximately 22% \n","and tangible book value per common share is up approximately 23% since 201810, while common shares outstanding have \n","decreased by approximately 21%. And, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in a steady and deliberate way. \n","Impact on communities \n","We seek broad impact in our communities, and I’m proud of the work we do. As a company, we are focused on building a \n","sustainable, inclusive future for all by supporting housing affordability, small business growth, financial health, and a low-carbon \n","economy. \n","In 2023, examples of our work include: \n","• \n","Donated approximately $300 million to over 3,000 nonprofits in support of housing, small business, financial health, \n","sustainability and other community needs \n","• \n","Strengthened local communities through approximately 800,000 hours of volunteer service from Wells Fargo employees \n","• \n","As part of our Banking Inclusion Initiative, introduced HOPE Inside Centers in 15 markets now supporting 57 retail \n","branches that provide financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching \n","• \n","Exceeded our $150 million Special Purpose Credit Program (SPCP) commitment to advance racial equity in \n","homeownership, helping customers refinance their mortgages to below market rate loans with reduced closing costs \n","• \n","Launched $10,000 Homebuyer AccessSM grants that will be applied toward the down payment for eligible homebuyers \n","who currently live in or are purchasing homes in certain underserved communities \n","• \n","Expanded our commitment to housing affordability through another $20 million breakthrough challenge to advance \n","ideas addressing the need for more affordable homes \n","• \n","Announced the Invest Native Initiative, a $20 million commitment to advance economic opportunities in Native \n","communities, and have already announced nearly $11 million in grants to 28 organizations across six states \n","• \n","Committed $25 million for UnidosUS community-focused programs and nonprofit affiliate partners to advance Latino \n","homeownership, of which $10 million will support the development of the HOME (Home Ownership Means Equity) \n","initiative \n","A number of these initiatives are covered in more detail in our 2023 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, which is available on \n","Wells Fargo’s website. The report also includes a broader overview of our DE&I work at Wells Fargo. \n","In addition, although I do not cover our sustainability work in detail in this year’s letter, you can find more about progress in our \n","Sustainability and Governance Report, our July 2023 TCFD Report, and our CO2eMission reporting, which are available on our \n","website. \n","Supporting our employees \n","Our employees are our greatest asset. We value their contributions to our company, and we continue to invest in them – \n","particularly employees with lower salaries. \n","Since 2019, we have increased wages for U.S. hourly employees by nearly 20% and increased the average pay rate for tellers by \n","34%. Earlier this year, we provided a special cash bonus of $1,000 to all eligible U.S.11 employees making $75,000 or less in annual \n","salary and less than $85,000 in total cash compensation. This award went to almost 100,000 people. \n","We provide eligible U.S. employees with numerous benefits designed to protect their physical and financial health and to help \n","them make the most of their financial future. Below are several examples:  \n","• \n","Up to 85% of per-paycheck cost of medical coverage, depending on compensation level, for U.S. employees. For \n","employees earning less than $48,000, Wells Fargo has lowered medical premiums by an average of 19% over the last five \n","years. \n","• \n","Approximately $1 billion in annual 401(k) contributions, with all eligible U.S. 401(k) plan participants receiving a dollar-\n","for-dollar company match of up to 6% for eligible compensation. Eligible U.S. employees earning less than $75,000 also \n","receive a company 401(k) contribution of 1% a year of eligible compensation. \n","• \n","Back-up care benefits, family-building benefits, wellness benefits, and other benefits \n","10  Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to \n","GAAP financial measures, see the \"Financial Review - Capital Management - Tangible Common Equity\" section in this Report.\n","11 Eligible employees outside the U.S. also received a one-time cash payment, adjusted according to local compensation levels. \n","viii     \n","  2023 Annual Report      ix \n","In addition to compensation and benefits, we also provide employees with skill and capability development and career growth \n","opportunities: \n","• \n","During 2023, we invested approximately $200 million in talent development, including skill development, functional \n","training, regulatory compliance, leadership and professional development. \n","• \n","In 2022, we launched our career development framework, which provides a holistic experience that enables our \n","employees to better manage their careers within our company.

Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking \n","statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are \n","described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” \n","sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). \n","When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries \n","(consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company. See the “Glossary of Acronyms” for definitions of terms used \n","throughout this Report. \n","Financial Review \n","Overview \n","Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company \n","that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets. We provide a \n","diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products \n","and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, \n","through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer \n","Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and \n","Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. \n","Wells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune’s 2023 rankings of \n","America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and \n","third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. \n","banks at December 31, 2023. \n","Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control \n","infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \n","Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other \n","regulatory actions, some of which are described below. These \n","regulatory actions may require the Company, among other \n","things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, \n","products and services, and risk management practices. \n","Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple \n","years, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays \n","along the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely \n","to continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and \n","control infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory \n","actions. Regulators have indicated the potential for escalating \n","consequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues or \n","have repeat issues. Furthermore, issues or delays with one \n","regulatory action could affect our progress on others. Failure to \n","satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis \n","could result in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, \n","limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or \n","liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse \n","consequences, which could be significant. While we still have \n","significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects \n","of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to \n","devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong \n","business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of \n","integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. \n","Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \n","Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \n","Risk Management \n","On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order \n","with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n","(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of \n","Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \n","the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the \n","Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the \n","Company’s compliance and operational risk management \n","program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the \n","Company works to address the consent order provisions. The \n","consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s \n","acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s \n","adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \n","third-party review of the enhancements and improvements \n","provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \n","and the plans are adopted and implemented to the satisfaction \n","of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined \n","under the consent order will be limited to the level as of \n","December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured \n","on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of \n","temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second \n","third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy \n","and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \n","Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection \n","Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \n","Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, \n","Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and \n","Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \n","On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders \n","with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the \n","Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an \n","aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters \n","regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program \n","and past practices involving certain automobile collateral \n","protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate \n","lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company \n","submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance \n","risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s \n","internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial \n","law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required \n","by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-\n","objection plans to remediate customers affected by the \n","automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage \n","interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management \n","of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The \n","Company continues to work to address the provisions of the \n","consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a \n","$250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to \n","insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s \n","April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the \n","Company’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the \n","CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would \n","terminate. \n","2 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation \n","Activities \n","On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent \n","order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the \n","execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation \n","activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent \n","order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party \n","residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain \n","mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the \n","Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is \n","provided. \n","Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile \n","Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage \n","Lending \n","On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent \n","order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer \n","remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, \n","consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain \n","practices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive \n","refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile \n","protection agreements; comply with certain business practice \n","requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a \n","$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related \n","to many of these matters were already substantially complete at \n","the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \n","order lays out a path to termination after the Company \n","completes the remainder of the required actions. \n","Retail Sales Practices Matters \n","In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \n","the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and \n","entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \n","in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \n","received products and services they did not request. As a result, it \n","remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \n","action plan that includes making things right for our customers, \n","employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \n","Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB \n","consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. On \n","February 15, 2024, the OCC announced the termination of its \n","consent order regarding retail sales practices. \n","Customer Remediation Activities \n","Our priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \n","areas or instances where customers may have experienced \n","financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \n","implement additional operational and control procedures. We are \n","working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. \n","We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \n","related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \n","may change based on additional facts and information, as well as \n","ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. We \n","had $819 million and $2.3 billion of accrued liabilities for \n","customer remediation activities as of December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, respectively. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we \n","continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we \n","have identified and may in the future identify additional items or \n","areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we \n","will continue to assess any customer harm and provide \n","remediation as appropriate. \n","Recent Developments \n","Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment \n","In November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \n","(FDIC) finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit \n","insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of 2023. \n","Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based \n","on a calculation using an insured depository institution’s (IDI) \n","estimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC’s \n","finalization of the rule, we expensed the entire estimated amount \n","of our special assessment of $1.9 billion (pre-tax), which will be \n","paid over eight quarters beginning in June 2024. The amount of \n","our special assessment may change as the FDIC determines the \n","actual losses to the deposit insurance fund and evaluates any \n","amendments by IDIs to uninsured deposit amounts reported for \n","December 31, 2022. \n","Overdraft Fees Proposal \n","On January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would \n","limit overdraft fees charged by certain banks. We expect a \n","significant reduction to our overdraft fees, which are included in \n","deposit-related fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed. \n","Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal \n","On October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would \n","reduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by \n","debit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for \n","an update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year \n","based on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card \n","issuers. We expect a significant reduction to our debit card \n","interchange fees, which are included in card fees, if the rule is \n","adopted as currently proposed. \n","Capital Matters \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","3 \n","On July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed \n","rule to implement the final components of Basel III, which would \n","impact risk-based capital requirements for certain banks. The \n","proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \n","and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \n","measurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \n","risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \n","new standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \n","new requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \n","beginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \n","increase in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \n","capital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed \n","rule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to \n","address the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet \n","and capital optimization strategies. \n","For additional information about capital planning, see the \n","“Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” \n","section in this Report. \n","Financial Performance \n","Adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \n","In first quarter 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards \n","Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – \n","Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted \n","Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. \n","We adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which \n","required revision of prior period financial statements.

All other business \n","activities that are not included in the reportable operating \n","segments have been included in Corporate. For additional \n","information, see Table 8. We define our reportable operating \n","segments by type of product and customer segment, and their \n","results are based on our management reporting process. The \n","management reporting process measures the performance of \n","the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \n","management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \n","with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \n","management. The management reporting process is based on \n","U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \n","transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \n","and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \n","consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \n","sources, which allows management to assess performance \n","consistently across the operating segments. \n","Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds \n","transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \n","liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \n","segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \n","funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \n","net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \n","credits is recognized in corporate treasury. \n","Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly \n","serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \n","providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \n","with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \n","business based on established internal revenue-sharing \n","agreements. \n","When a line of business uses a service provided by another \n","line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \n","expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \n","service provided. We periodically assess and update our revenue \n","and expense allocation methodologies. \n","Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent \n","adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \n","debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\n","equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\n","income housing and renewable energy investments are included \n","in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \n","to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \n","Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \n","Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s \n","consolidated financial results. \n","Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated \n","capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \n","on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \n","assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \n","periodically assessed and updated. Effective January 1, 2023, \n","management modified its capital allocation methodology to \n","improve alignment of allocated capital with the binding \n","regulatory constraints of the Company.

In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities \n","with a fair value of $3.7 billion to HTM debt securities in 2023 \n","due to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital \n","management purposes.

The maximum credit risk for these commitments will \n","generally be lower than the contractual amount because these \n","commitments may expire without being used or may be \n","cancelled at the customer’s request.

For additional information, see Note 16 \n","(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial \n","Statements in this Report. \n","Guarantees and Other Arrangements \n","Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make \n","payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in \n","an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are \n","generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, \n","written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing \n","house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar \n","arrangements.

For additional information, \n","see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","27 \n","Risk Management \n","Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly \n","affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the \n","expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and \n","other stakeholders. \n","Risk is Part of our Business Model.  Risk is the possibility of an \n","event occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability \n","to achieve its strategic and business objectives. The Company \n","routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its \n","customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest \n","rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, \n","such as operational (which includes compliance and model risks), \n","strategic and reputation risks. \n","Risk Profile.  The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the \n","aggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and \n","business activities after taking into consideration risk \n","management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk \n","profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. \n","Risk Capacity.  Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that \n","the Company could assume given its current level of resources \n","before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital \n","and liquidity needs. \n","Risk Appetite.  Risk appetite is the nature and level of risk the \n","Company is willing to take, within its risk capacity, while pursuing \n","its strategic and business objectives. Risk appetite is articulated \n","in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable \n","risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The \n","Company’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior \n","management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps \n","guide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company \n","continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews \n","reports which include risk appetite information and analysis. \n","Risk and Strategy.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the \n","Company’s strategic planning process, which identifies the \n","Company’s most significant opportunities and challenges, \n","develops plans to address them, evaluates the risks of those \n","plans, and articulates the resulting decisions in the form of a \n","company-wide strategic plan. The Company’s risk profile, risk \n","capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are \n","considered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with \n","the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s \n","Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates \n","in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent \n","assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM \n","also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the \n","strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk \n","management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, \n","enterprise functions, and aggregate Company levels. The \n","strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s \n","evaluation. \n","Risk and Climate Change.  The Company views climate change as \n","a global challenge that presents significant impacts for \n","businesses and communities around the world. The Company \n","expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk \n","types it manages, and the Company continues to integrate \n","climate considerations into its risk management framework as its \n","understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. \n","Risk is Managed by Everyone.  Every employee, in the course of \n","their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing \n","risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, \n","including establishing and maintaining the Company’s risk and \n","control environment. Every employee must comply with \n","applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \n","Risk and Culture.  Senior management sets the tone at the top \n","by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \n","expectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees \n","conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board is \n","responsible for holding senior management accountable for \n","establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively \n","managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak \n","up when they see something that could cause harm to the \n","Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, \n","or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s \n","responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to \n","challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their \n","concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s \n","performance management and incentive compensation \n","programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk \n","and reward under core principles that employees are expected to \n","know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources \n","Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing \n","credible challenge to the Company’s performance management \n","and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk \n","management is a central component of employee performance \n","evaluations. \n","Risk Management Framework.  The Company’s risk \n","management framework sets forth the Company’s core \n","principles for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by \n","the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. \n","Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. \n","Wells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by \n","building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We \n","continue to enhance and mature our risk management programs, \n","including operational and compliance risk management programs \n","as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s \n","April 20, 2018, consent orders. \n","Risk Governance \n","Role of the Board.  The Board oversees the Company’s business, \n","including its risk management. It assesses senior management’s \n","performance and holds senior management accountable for \n","maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management \n","program. \n","Board Committee Structure.  The Board carries out its risk \n","oversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. \n","The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk \n","management framework and oversees management’s \n","implementation of the framework, including how the Company \n","manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the \n","Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk \n","Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of \n","IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation. The Chief \n","Risk Officer (CRO) reports functionally to the Risk Committee \n","and administratively to the CEO. \n","28 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Management Committee Structure.  The Company has \n","established management committees, including those focused \n","on risk, that support management in carrying out its governance \n","and risk management responsibilities. One type of management \n","committee is a governance committee, which is a decision-\n","making body that operates for a particular purpose and may \n","report to a Board committee. \n","Each management governance committee, in accordance \n","with its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make \n","decisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging \n","risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review \n","and monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and \n","remediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key \n","challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues \n","as appropriate. \n","Table 15 presents, as of December 31, 2023, the structure \n","of the Company’s Board committees and escalation paths of \n","relevant management governance committees reporting to a \n","Board committee. \n","Table 15: Board and Relevant Management-level Governance Committee Structure \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Audit \n","Committee (1) \n","Finance \n","Committee \n","Corporate \n","Responsibility \n","Committee \n","Risk \n","Committee \n","Governance & \n","Nominating \n","Committee \n","Human \n","Resources \n","Committee \n","Management Governance Committees \n","Disclosure \n","Committee \n","Capital \n","Management \n","Committee \n","Allowance for Credit \n","Losses Approval \n","Governance \n","Committee \n","Enterprise Risk & \n","Control Committee \n","Incentive \n","Compensation \n","& Performance \n","Management \n","Committee \n","Regulatory \n","Reporting \n","Oversight \n","Committee \n","Corporate \n","Asset/Liability \n","Committee \n","Risk & Control \n","Committees \n","Recovery & \n","Resolution \n","Committee \n","Risk Type \n","Committees \n","Risk Topic \n","Committees \n","(1) \n","The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s financial statements and disclosures to shareholders and regulatory agencies; oversees the internal audit function and \n","external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and assists the Board and the Risk Committee in the oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. \n","Management Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk \n","Committee of the Board.  The Enterprise Risk & Control \n","Committee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that \n","governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives \n","information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated \n","risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC \n","also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to \n","the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives \n","regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management \n","regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s \n","assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk \n","management program. \n","The ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, with  \n","membership comprising the heads of principal lines of business \n","and certain enterprise functions. The Chief Auditor or a designee \n","attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct \n","escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also has an \n","escalation path for certain human capital risks and issues to the \n","Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate \n","directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC \n","in accordance with the Company’s escalation management \n","policy. \n","Each principal line of business and enterprise function has a \n","risk and control committee, which is a management governance \n","committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its \n","scope limited to the respective principal line of business or \n","enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider \n","risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise \n","function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line \n","of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. \n","As a complement to these risk and control committees, \n","management governance committees dedicated to specific risk \n","types and risk topics also report to the ERCC to enable more \n","comprehensive governance of risks. \n","Risk Operating Model – Roles and Responsibilities \n","The Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the \n","Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. \n","• \n","Front Line  The Front Line, which comprises principal line of \n","business and certain enterprise function activities, is the first \n","line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for \n","understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying \n","adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its \n","business activities. The Front Line identifies, measures and \n","assesses, controls, monitors, and reports on risk generated \n","by or associated with its business activities and balances risk \n","and reward in decision making while operating within the \n","Company’s risk appetite. \n","• \n","Independent Risk Management  IRM is the second line of \n","defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk \n","management program and provides oversight, including \n","challenge to and independent assessment and monitoring \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","29 \n","of, the Front Line’s execution of its risk management \n","responsibilities. \n","• \n","Internal Audit  Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is \n","responsible for acting as an independent assurance function \n","and validates that the risk management program is \n","adequately designed and functioning effectively. \n","Risk Type Classifications \n","The Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and \n","ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs \n","and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit \n","the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, \n","including emerging risk exposures. \n","Operational Risk Management \n","Operational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this \n","section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk \n","resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people \n","and systems, or from external events. \n","The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \n","responsibility for operational risk, including significant \n","supporting programs and/or policies regarding the Company’s \n","business resiliency and disaster recovery, change management, \n","data management, information security, technology, and third-\n","party risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, \n","the Board’s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant \n","operational risk policies and oversees the Company’s operational \n","risk management program. \n","At the management level, Operational Risk Management, \n","which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for operational \n","risk. Operational Risk Management reports to the CRO and \n","provides periodic reports related to operational risk to the \n","Board’s Risk Committee. Operational Risk Management’s \n","oversight responsibilities include change management risk, data \n","management risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, information \n","management risk, information security risk, technology risk, and \n","third-party risk. \n","Information Security Risk Management.  Information security \n","risk, which includes cybersecurity risk, is a significant operational \n","risk for financial institutions such as Wells Fargo and includes the \n","risk arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, \n","modification, or destruction of information or information \n","systems. \n","The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \n","responsibility for information security risk and approves the \n","Company’s information security program, which includes \n","information protection and cyber resiliency. The Risk Committee \n","receives regular reports from the Company’s Head of \n","Technology, as well as from Operational Risk Management \n","representatives, on information security risks, and the Board \n","receives a report from the Head of Technology on Wells Fargo’s \n","information security program and receives reports from \n","management on significant information security developments, \n","including certain incidents involving third parties. \n","As described above, at the management level, Operational \n","Risk Management has oversight responsibility for information \n","security risk. As a second line of defense, Operational Risk \n","Management reviews and provides guidance to the Front Line \n","technology team, including with respect to the development and \n","maintenance of risk management policies, governance \n","documents, processes, and controls, and oversees and challenges \n","the Front Line technology team’s risk assessment activities. \n","The Company’s cybersecurity team, which is part of the \n","broader technology team, provides Front Line information \n","security risk assessment and management and is responsible for \n","protecting the Company’s information systems, networks, and \n","data, including customer and employee data, through the design, \n","execution, and oversight of our information security program. \n","The technology team is led by the Company’s Head of \n","Technology, who reports to the CEO and leads our efforts to \n","manage information security and related risks across the \n","enterprise, including overseeing the Company’s Chief \n","Information Security Officer (CISO). Our Head of Technology has \n","nearly 20 years of technology and information security risk \n","management experience in the financial services industry, \n","including prior roles with Wells Fargo as Chief Information \n","Officer for the Consumer Technology group and the Enterprise \n","Functions Technology group. Prior to joining Wells Fargo, our \n","Head of Technology served as Chief Operations and Technology \n","Officer at a financing and investment solutions company, and \n","prior to that served in several technology leadership roles at large \n","financial institutions. \n","The Company has processes designed to prevent, detect, \n","mitigate, escalate, and remediate cybersecurity incidents, \n","including monitoring of the Company’s networks for actual or \n","potential attacks or breaches.

Extension terms generally range from six to \n","thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","33 \n","additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or \n","additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of \n","collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to \n","repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside \n","repayment guarantee in providing the extension. \n","Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly \n","related to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and \n","willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or \n","more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the \n","most current financial information available and is focused on \n","various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and \n","current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s \n","reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us \n","based on our analysis, as well as other lenders’ experience with \n","the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength \n","is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk \n","rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance \n","for credit losses methodology. \n","In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate \n","the collateral and future cash flows, as well as the anticipated \n","support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the \n","strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full \n","repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely \n","collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the \n","performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual \n","status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in \n","accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net \n","realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. \n","COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  Our CRE loan portfolio is \n","composed of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. The \n","total CRE loan portfolio decreased $5.2 billion from \n","December 31, 2022, as paydowns exceeded originations and \n","advances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by \n","property type.

The increase in criticized CRE \n","mortgage loans was predominantly driven by the office and \n","apartments property types.

Residential mortgage – first lien loans represented 96% of \n","the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, \n","2023, compared with 95% at December 31, 2022. \n","The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with \n","adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a \n","result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage \n","(ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that \n","limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. \n","The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. \n","ARM loans were 7% of total loans at both December 31, 2023 \n","and 2022, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for the \n","majority of this portfolio at December 31, 2023. We do not offer \n","option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage \n","products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to \n","within the financial services industry as negative amortizing \n","mortgage loans. \n","The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of \n","residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are \n","subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. \n","These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only \n","payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar \n","features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing \n","payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods \n","between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit \n","performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio \n","for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity \n","of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan \n","is delinquent. \n","The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of \n","credit was $15.0 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with \n","$18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded credit \n","commitments for these lines of credit totaled $28.6 billion at \n","December 31, 2023, compared with $35.5 billion at \n","December 31, 2022. Our residential mortgage lines of credit \n","(both first and junior lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 \n","or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options \n","available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% \n","of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. The lines \n","that enter their amortization period may experience higher \n","delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or \n","term period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL \n","for loans estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were \n","approximately 2% of total loans at both December 31, 2023 and \n","2022. \n","During the draw period, the borrower has the option of \n","converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate \n","to a fixed rate. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit \n","generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with \n","repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time \n","of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a \n","Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) \n","36 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the \n","outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The \n","conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff \n","may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect \n","some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance. As \n","borrowers near the end of their draw period, we work with them \n","to transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or \n","full repayment. \n","We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying \n","economic or market conditions for the geographic areas of our \n","residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk \n","management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio \n","includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price \n","Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models \n","(AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based \n","tools used to estimate the market value of homes. We have \n","processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk \n","management guidelines addressing the circumstances when \n","AVMs may be used. For additional information about our use of \n","appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance \n","for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, \n","current Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan to \n","collateral values (LTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan \n","portfolio. For junior lien mortgages, LTV uses the total combined \n","loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused \n","line of credit amounts). For additional information regarding \n","credit quality indicators, see Note 5 (Loans and Related \n","Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report. \n","We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist \n","homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial \n","difficulties. Under these programs, we may provide concessions \n","such as interest rate reductions, term extensions, forbearance of \n","principal, and in some cases, principal forgiveness.

Our process for \n","Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) \n","42 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting \n","Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 \n","(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial \n","Statements in this Report. \n","MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and \n","commercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) \n","government-sponsored entities (GSEs), Federal Home Loan \n","Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage \n","Association (FNMA), who include the mortgage loans in GSE-\n","guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private \n","label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase \n","mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In \n","addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential \n","mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed \n","by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We \n","may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify \n","the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the \n","securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred \n","on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of \n","contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied \n","within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of \n","the breach. \n","In connection with our sales and securitization of residential \n","mortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase \n","liability, initially at fair value, related to various representations \n","and warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for \n","loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or \n","not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of \n","factors. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \n","Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional \n","information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase \n","losses. \n","We provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage \n","loans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms \n","of certain programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of \n","actual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 17 \n","(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements \n","in this Report for additional information about our exposure to \n","loss related to these programs. \n","In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \n","servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial \n","mortgage loans included in GSE mortgage securitizations, \n","GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/ \n","VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage \n","securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by \n","institutional investors. \n","The loans we service were originated by us or by other \n","mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are \n","typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance \n","certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the \n","mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or \n","primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage \n","loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of \n","taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) \n","foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent \n","consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider \n","alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short \n","sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property \n","through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are \n","typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of \n","the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent \n","amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform \n","their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of \n","reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by \n","investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 \n","(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report for additional information about residential and \n","commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. \n","In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \n","transfer as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from \n","certain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable \n","based on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan \n","payments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to \n","repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding \n","liability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to \n","repurchase the loan. We may repurchase these loans for cash and \n","as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. \n","Loans repurchased from GNMA securitization pools that \n","regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance \n","with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future \n","GNMA loan securitization pools. At December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, these loans, which we have repurchased or have the \n","unilateral option to repurchase, were $7.8 billion and $9.8 billion, \n","respectively, which included $7.4 billion and $8.6 billion, \n","respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in \n","loans held for sale. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable \n","Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for \n","additional information about our involvement with mortgage \n","loan securitizations. \n","Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master \n","servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for \n","actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify \n","the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or \n","master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, \n","if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master \n","servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not \n","cured within a specified period. The standards governing \n","servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible \n","remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those \n","standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides \n","maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and \n","individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs \n","from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification \n","or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in \n","connection with our servicing activities, we could continue to \n","become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements \n","with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and \n","practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers \n","with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure \n","prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions \n","or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","43 \n","Asset/Liability Management \n","Asset/liability management involves measuring, monitoring and \n","managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. \n","Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides \n","with the Finance Committee of the Board, while primary \n","oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk \n","Committee of the Board. These committees oversee the \n","administration and effectiveness of financial risk management \n","policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. \n","At the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability \n","Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management \n","from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and \n","supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance \n","Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in \n","more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate \n","management level oversight specific to market risk. \n","INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is the risk that market \n","fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange \n","can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming \n","from mismatches in the cash flows of the Company’s assets and \n","liabilities generally arising from customer-related lending and \n","deposit-taking activities. We are subject to interest rate risk \n","because: \n","• \n","assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times \n","or by different amounts; \n","• \n","short-term and long-term market interest rates may change \n","independently or with different magnitudes; \n","• \n","the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \n","shorten or lengthen as interest rates change; or \n","• \n","interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on \n","loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, loan origination \n","volume, and the fair value of financial instruments and \n","MSRs. \n","We assess interest rate risk by comparing the earnings \n","outcomes from multiple interest rate scenarios that differ in the \n","direction of interest rate changes, the degree and speed of \n","interest rate changes over time, and the projected shape of the \n","yield curve. These scenarios require assumptions regarding \n","drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan \n","originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, \n","deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. We \n","periodically assess and enhance our scenarios and assumptions. \n","Our scenario assumptions reflected the following: \n","• \n","Scenarios are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our \n","assets and liabilities over time. \n","• \n","Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \n","across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \n","lower interest rates. \n","• \n","Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \n","with the changes in interest rates are held constant. \n","• \n","The funding forecast in our base scenario incorporates \n","deposit mix changes and market funding levels consistent \n","with the base interest rate trajectory. Our hypothetical \n","scenarios incorporate deposit mix that is the same as in the \n","base scenario. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer \n","deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding \n","products and/or requires additional market funding could \n","reduce the expected benefit from higher rates. \n","• \n","The interest rate sensitivity of deposits as market interest \n","rates change, referred to as deposit betas, are informed by \n","historical behavior and expectations for near-term pricing \n","strategies. Our actual experience may differ from \n","expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit \n","repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. \n","Table 30 presents the results of the estimated net interest \n","income sensitivity over the next 12 months from the multiple \n","scenarios compared with our base scenario. The base scenario is a \n","reference point used by the Company for financial planning \n","purposes. These hypothetical scenarios include instantaneous \n","movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher \n","interest rates under a parallel shift, as well as steeper and flatter \n","non-parallel changes in the yield curve. Long-term interest rates \n","are defined as all tenors three years and longer, and short-term \n","interest rates are defined as all tenors less than three years. \n","Table 30: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months \n","Using Instantaneous Movements \n","($ in billions) \n","Dec 31, 2023 \n","Dec 31, 2022 \n","Parallel shift: \n","+100 bps shift in interest rates \n","$ \n","1.8 \n","2.3 \n","-100 bps shift in interest rates \n","(2.0) \n","(1.7) \n","Steeper yield curve: \n","+100 bps shift in long-term interest rates \n","1.1 \n","0.8 \n","-100 bps shift in short-term interest rates \n","(1.0) \n","(1.0) \n","Flatter yield curve: \n","+100 bps shift in short-term interest rates \n","0.7 \n","1.5 \n","-100 bps shift in long-term interest rates \n","(1.1) \n","(0.7) \n","Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect \n","to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice \n","faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the \n","case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward \n","and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net \n","interest income. The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from \n","December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, reflected updates \n","for our expected balance sheet composition, including a shift to \n","higher cost deposits. The magnitude of the benefit, if any, from \n","higher interest rates may vary from our scenarios, including \n","because future deposit pricing and balances may be different \n","from our current expectations. The realized impact of interest \n","rate changes may also vary from our base and hypothetical \n","scenarios for various reasons, including any deposit pricing lags. \n","We use interest rate derivatives and our debt securities \n","portfolio to manage our interest rate exposures. We use \n","derivatives for asset/liability management to (i) convert cash \n","flows from selected assets and/or liabilities from floating-rate \n","payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa, (ii) reduce \n","accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) sensitivity of \n","our AFS debt securities portfolio, and/or (iii) economically hedge \n","our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and \n","MSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \n","are presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in \n","this Report. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of \n","AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the \n","amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized \n","gains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS \n","to HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the \n","life of the security with no further impact from interest rate \n","changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting \n","Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity \n","Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for \n","additional information on our debt securities portfolio. \n","44 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","In addition to the net interest income sensitivity above, we \n","also measure and evaluate the economic value sensitivity (EVS) \n","of our balance sheet. EVS is the change in the present value of \n","the life-time cash flows of the Company’s assets and liabilities \n","across a range of scenarios. It is based on the existing balance \n","sheet, at a point in time, and helps indicate whether we are \n","exposed to higher or lower interest rates. We manage EVS \n","through a set of limits that are designed to align with our interest \n","rate risk appetite. \n","Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense \n","are impacted by mortgage banking activities that may have \n","sensitivity impacts that move in the opposite direction of our net \n","interest income. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability \n","Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market \n","Risk” section in this Report for additional information. \n","Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \n","by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits \n","that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees \n","on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the \n","impact to net interest income does not include the fair value \n","changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \n","related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \n","addition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \n","noninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \n","the actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional \n","information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 \n","(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We \n","originate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \n","various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \n","risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \n","other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \n","securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage \n","loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \n","commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \n","investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \n","management activities. We may also retain securities in our \n","investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \n","Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \n","noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \n","the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan \n","commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage \n","applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \n","mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \n","the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \n","demand, as well as the time required for processing a new \n","application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \n","selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \n","on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest \n","rates. \n","The valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly \n","subjective and involve complex judgments by management \n","about matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in \n","interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions \n","captured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including \n","prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the \n","servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow \n","balances and other servicing valuation elements. See the “Critical \n","Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage \n","Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional \n","information on the valuation of our residential MSRs. \n","An increase in interest rates generally reduces the \n","propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the \n","servicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair \n","value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also \n","reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, \n","which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A \n","decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. \n","To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our \n","residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of \n","derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar \n","futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest \n","rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in \n","mortgage banking is a complex process that requires \n","sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are \n","several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking \n","related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and \n","associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of \n","volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and \n","changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to \n","balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the \n","financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the \n","values and income being hedged. \n","The size of the hedge and the particular combination of \n","hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce \n","the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a \n","range of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the \n","composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the \n","relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our \n","mortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types \n","of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and \n","rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and \n","the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. \n","For additional information on mortgage banking, including \n","key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see \n","Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and \n","Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial \n","Statements in this Report. \n","MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \n","from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest \n","rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and \n","commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to \n","counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, \n","basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the \n","trading book, mortgage servicing rights, the hedge effectiveness \n","risk associated with the mortgage book held at fair value, and \n","impairment on private equity investments. \n","The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight \n","responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s \n","market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In \n","addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight \n","responsibilities with respect to market risk, including \n","counterparty risk. The Finance Committee also reports key \n","market risk matters to the Risk Committee. \n","At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk \n","Management function, which is part of IRM, has oversight \n","responsibility for market risk across the enterprise. The Market \n","and Counterparty Risk Management function reports into \n","Corporate and Investment Banking Risk and provides periodic \n","reports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance Committee \n","and Risk Committee, as applicable. \n","MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading \n","activities to accommodate the investment and risk management \n","activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to \n","manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities \n","predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser \n","extent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","45 \n","for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans, and \n","trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading \n","activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the \n","financial instruments used in our trading activities include net \n","interest income, changes in fair value, and realized gains and \n","losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is \n","reflected in the interest income and interest expense \n","components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes \n","in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading \n","activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For \n","additional information on the financial instruments used in our \n","trading activities and the income from these trading activities, \n","see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report. \n","Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to \n","estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial \n","markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with \n","sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and \n","monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are \n","monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated \n","levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management \n","function aggregates and monitors exposures against our \n","established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are \n","analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors \n","various market risk exposure measures from a variety of \n","perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and \n","legal entity. \n","Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \n","market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The \n","Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes \n","to establish and monitor line of business and Company-wide risk \n","limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on \n","our consolidated balance sheet. \n","Table 31 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk \n","category. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation \n","model which assumes that historical changes in market values \n","are representative of the potential future outcomes and \n","measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a \n","1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical \n","simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a \n","12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a \n","12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is \n","responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence \n","level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur \n","single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on \n","average once every 100 trading days. \n","Table 31: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category \n","Year ended December 31, \n","2023 \n","2022 \n","(in millions) \n","Period \n","end \n","Average \n","Low \n","High \n","Period \n","end \n","Average \n","Low \n","High \n","Company Trading General VaR Risk Categories \n","Credit \n","$ \n","30 \n","35 \n","20 \n","52 \n","29 \n","32 \n","19 \n","85 \n","Interest rate \n","16 \n","33 \n","9 \n","65 \n","25 \n","25 \n","9 \n","88 \n","Equity \n","23 \n","21 \n","13 \n","31 \n","27 \n","23 \n","13 \n","38 \n","Commodity \n","3 \n","4 \n","2 \n","8 \n","4 \n","6 \n","2 \n","20 \n","Foreign exchange \n","1 \n","1 \n","0 \n","4 \n","1 \n","1 \n","0 \n","2 \n","Diversification benefit (1) \n","(36) \n","(59) \n","(47) \n","(52) \n","Company Trading General VaR \n","$ \n","37 \n","35 \n","39 \n","35 \n","(1) \n","The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated \n","causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on \n","different days. \n","Sensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR \n","models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity \n","analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the \n","measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% \n","increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We \n","conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, \n","volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. \n","Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication \n","of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market \n","moves. \n","Stress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to \n","adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, \n","stress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to \n","extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios \n","estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions \n","of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit \n","spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These \n","scenarios assume that the market moves happen \n","instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes \n","place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative \n","approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). \n","An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both \n","historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad \n","range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation \n","and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the \n","impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio \n","values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase \n","across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. \n","Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress \n","scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis \n","addresses how these events might affect the risk factors \n","relevant to a portfolio. \n","The Company’s stress testing framework is also used in \n","calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s \n","Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal \n","stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated \n","to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail \n","on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in \n","this Report. \n","MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly \n","affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage \n","equity investments in various businesses, such as start-up \n","companies and emerging growth companies. We also invest in \n","Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) \n","46 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","funds that make similar private equity investments. These \n","private equity investments are made within capital allocations \n","approved by management and the Board. The Board reviews \n","business developments, key risks and historical returns for the \n","private equity investment portfolio at least annually. \n","Management reviews these investments at least quarterly to \n","assess them for impairment and observable price changes. For \n","nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts \n","and circumstances of each individual investment and the \n","expectations for that investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the \n","viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable \n","price changes that are similar to the investments held. \n","Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private \n","equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair \n","value through net income, and the measurement alternative. \n","As part of our business to support our customers, we trade \n","public equities, listed/over-the-counter equity derivatives, and \n","convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these \n","activities. We also have marketable equity securities that include \n","investments relating to our venture capital activities. We manage \n","these marketable equity securities within capital risk limits \n","approved by management and the Board and monitored by \n","Corporate ALCO and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value \n","changes in these marketable equity securities are recognized in \n","net income. For additional information, see Note 4 (Equity \n","Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect \n","our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under \n","management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability \n","to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock \n","market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and \n","other business activities. Each business line monitors and \n","manages these indirect risks. \n","LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  Liquidity risk is the risk arising from \n","the inability of the Company to meet obligations when they \n","come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without \n","incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we \n","enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash \n","payments, including funding for customer loan requests, \n","customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, \n","leases for premises and equipment, and other cash \n","commitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of \n","deposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-\n","operational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity \n","management is to be able to meet our contractual obligations \n","and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal \n","operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific \n","and/or market stress. For additional information on these \n","obligations, see the following sections and Notes to Financial \n","Statements in this Report: \n","• \n","“Unfunded Credit Commitments” section within Loans and \n","Related Allowance for Credit Losses (Note 5) \n","• \n","Leasing Activity (Note 8) \n","• \n","Deposits (Note 9) \n","• \n","Long-Term Debt (Note 10) \n","• \n","Guarantees and Other Commitments (Note 17) \n","• \n","Employee Benefits (Note 22) \n","• \n","Income Taxes (Note 23) \n","To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity \n","guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover \n","potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence \n","on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are \n","monitored on a monthly basis by the management-level \n","Corporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by \n","the Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for \n","both the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that \n","the Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries. \n","Liquidity Stress Tests  Liquidity stress tests are performed to \n","help the Company maintain sufficient liquidity to meet \n","contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of \n","stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as  \n","idiosyncratic events, including a range of stress conditions and \n","time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of the \n","Company’s projected liquidity position during stress and inform \n","future needs in the Company’s funding plan. \n","Contingency Funding Plan  Our contingency funding plan (CFP), \n","which is approved by the Corporate Asset/Liability Committee \n","and the Board’s Risk Committee, sets out the Company’s \n","strategies and action plans to address potential liquidity needs \n","during market-wide or idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP \n","establishes measures for monitoring emerging liquidity events \n","and describes the processes for communicating and managing \n","stress events should they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate \n","funding and liquidity strategies available to the Company in a \n","period of stress. \n","Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, \n","OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity \n","requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) \n","established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \n","(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold \n","high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or \n","greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day \n","stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists \n","of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and \n","mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies \n","to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) \n","with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued \n","by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management \n","standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as \n","Wells Fargo. \n","We are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and \n","FDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the \n","net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking \n","organization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum \n","amount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term \n","debt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, \n","derivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon \n","period. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with \n","total assets of $10 billion or more.

Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted \n","ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets \n","and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. \n","RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company \n","is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to \n","implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking \n","organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating \n","capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced \n","Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, \n","and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both \n","approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \n","capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \n","distributions and discretionary bonus payments. \n","On July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \n","proposed rule to implement the final components of Basel III, \n","which would impact risk-based capital requirements for certain \n","banks. The proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced \n","Approach and replace it with a new expanded risk-based \n","approach for the measurement of risk-weighted assets, including \n","more granular risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk \n","framework, and a new standardized approach for measuring \n","operational risk. The new requirements would be phased in over a \n","three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects \n","a significant increase in its risk-weighted assets and a net \n","increase in its capital requirements based on an assessment of \n","the proposed rule. The Company is considering a range of \n","potential actions to address the impact of the proposed rule, \n","including balance sheet and capital optimization strategies. \n","Table 37 and Table 38 present the risk-based capital \n","requirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized \n","Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of \n","December 31, 2023. \n","Table 37: Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized Approach \n","Standardized Approach \n","8.90% \n","10.40% \n","12.40% \n","4.50% \n","6.00% \n","8.00% \n","2.90% \n","2.90% \n","2.90% \n","1.50% \n","1.50% \n","1.50% \n","Minimum requirement \n","Stress capital buffer \n","G-SIB capital surcharge \n","Common Equity Tier 1 \n","(CET1) ratio \n","Tier 1 capital ratio \n","Total capital ratio \n","Table 38: Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Advanced Approach \n","Advanced Approach \n","8.50% \n","10.00% \n","12.00% \n","4.50% \n","6.00% \n","8.00% \n","2.50% \n","2.50% \n","2.50% \n","1.50% \n","1.50% \n","1.50% \n","Minimum requirement \n","Capital conservation buffer \n","G-SIB capital surcharge \n","Common Equity Tier 1 \n","(CET1) ratio \n","Tier 1 capital ratio \n","Total capital ratio \n","In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described \n","in Table 37 and Table 38, if the FRB determines that a period of \n","excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic \n","risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the \n","risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking \n","regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at December 31, \n","2023, was 0.00%. \n","The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain \n","institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach \n","and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or \n","financial stress. \n","The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease \n","in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse \n","scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related \n","Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four \n","quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress \n","capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ \n","over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based \n","capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are \n","subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for \n","the period October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, is \n","2.90%. \n","50 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also \n","subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital \n","surcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio \n","requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually \n","calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher \n","of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers \n","our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, \n","substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the \n","methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability \n","Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar \n","inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term \n","wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges \n","than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is \n","calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the \n","amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If \n","our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital \n","surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our \n","annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital \n","surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our \n","G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2024. On \n","July 27, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would impact \n","the methodology used to calculate the G-SIB capital surcharge. \n","Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets \n","and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance \n","sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories \n","according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the \n","nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk \n","category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with \n","that category.

As of December 31, 2023, these broker-dealer \n","subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory \n","minimum net capital requirements. \n","Capital Planning and Stress Testing \n","Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet \n","regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-\n","term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow \n","our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying \n","environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return \n","capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital \n","structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital \n","requirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the \n","stress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory \n","requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, \n","changes in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our \n","long-term target capital levels are set above their respective \n","regulatory minimums plus buffers. \n","The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \n","other requirements that govern capital distributions, including \n","dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \n","Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \n","financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \n","when evaluating their capital plans. \n","As part of the annual CCAR, the FRB generates a supervisory \n","stress test. The FRB reviews the supervisory stress test results as \n","required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of \n","capital actions for all large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s \n","proposed capital actions. \n","Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and \n","banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the \n","institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during \n","periods of adverse economic and financial conditions. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","55 \n","Securities Repurchases \n","On July 25, 2023 we announced that our Board authorized a \n","common stock repurchase program of up to $30 billion. Unless \n","modified or revoked by the Board, this authorization does not \n","expire and is our only common stock repurchase program in \n","effect. At December 31, 2023, we had remaining Board authority \n","to repurchase up to approximately $26.7 billion of common \n","stock. \n","Various factors impact the amount and timing of our share \n","repurchases, including the earnings, cash requirements and \n","financial condition of the Company, the impact to our balance \n","sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements \n","and long-term targeted capital structure, the results of \n","supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading \n","price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, \n","including regulatory requirements under the FRB’s capital plan \n","rule. Although we announce when the Board authorizes a share \n","repurchase program, we typically do not give any public notice \n","before we repurchase our shares. Due to the various factors that \n","may impact the amount and timing of our share repurchases and \n","the fact that we may be in the market throughout the year, our \n","share repurchases occur at various prices. We may suspend share \n","repurchase activity at any time. \n","Furthermore, the Company has a variety of benefit plans in \n","which employees may own or obtain shares of our common \n","stock. The Company may buy shares from these plans to \n","accommodate employee preferences and these purchases are \n","subtracted from our repurchase authority. \n","For additional information about share repurchases during \n","fourth quarter 2023, see Part II, Item 5 in our 2023 Form 10-K. \n","Regulatory Matters \n","The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant \n","regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation \n","and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services \n","companies conduct business and may continue to result in \n","increased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights \n","the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight \n","initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For \n","additional information about the regulatory matters discussed \n","below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, \n","see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2023 Form \n","10-K, and the “Overview,” “Capital Management,” “Forward-\n","Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 26 \n","(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Dodd-Frank Act \n","The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform \n","legislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional \n","information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its \n","rulemaking initiatives. \n","• \n","Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important \n","firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal \n","banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and \n","regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. \n","The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing \n","enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding \n","companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based \n","capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single \n","counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity \n","limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave \n","threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB \n","and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress \n","testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. \n","Furthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and \n","the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the \n","FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of \n","directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, \n","has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance \n","and risk management standards for large national banks \n","such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require \n","covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk \n","governance framework to manage and control their risk-\n","taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and \n","responsibilities for risk management practices within \n","covered banks and create certain risk oversight \n","responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to \n","the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory \n","requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-\n","Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight \n","Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may \n","recommend new systemic risk management requirements \n","and require new reporting of systemic risks. \n","• \n","Regulation of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank \n","Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n","(CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate \n","disclosures regarding financial products and are protected \n","from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has \n","issued and proposed a number of rules impacting consumer \n","financial products, including rules impacting residential \n","mortgage lending, credit cards, and other financial products \n","and banking related activities, as well as the fees that may be \n","charged for certain banking products and services. In \n","addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is \n","continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of \n","the financial services industry with respect to a number of \n","consumer businesses and products, including mortgage \n","lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto \n","finance. \n","• \n","Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities.  The \n","Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for \n","regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to \n","authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity \n","Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and \n","Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive \n","sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, \n","respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory \n","agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared \n","swaps and security-based swaps. As a registered swap dealer \n","and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, \n","Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, \n","as well as others adopted or under consideration by \n","regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may \n","negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter \n","derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new \n","derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may \n","increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based \n","swaps, and other derivatives activities. \n","Regulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements \n","The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various \n","regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the \n","FRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules \n","Capital Management (continued) \n","56 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-\n","based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The \n","Company and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified \n","leverage and supplementary leverage ratios. In addition, the \n","Company is required to have a minimum amount of total loss \n","absorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. \n","Federal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a \n","liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For \n","additional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage \n","and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable \n","to us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – \n","Liquidity Standards” sections in this Report. \n","“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters \n","Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank \n","Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to \n","prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as \n","“living wills,” designed to facilitate their rapid and orderly \n","resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. \n","Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a \n","reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the \n","U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable \n","period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the \n","risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the \n","financial stability of the United States. In addition to the \n","Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, \n","Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare \n","and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC \n","determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may \n","impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements \n","on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we \n","adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC \n","ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any \n","deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or \n","operations. On June 27, 2023, we submitted our most recent \n","resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. \n","If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \n","proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \n","regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly \n","liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for \n","the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically \n","important financial institution that is in default or in danger of \n","default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution \n","under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse \n","effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is \n","appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation \n","authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would \n","determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and \n","obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation \n","authority requires that security holders of a company in \n","receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to \n","any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of \n","creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. \n","Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the \n","strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \n","in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims \n","procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ \n","claims. \n"," The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \n","a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \n","only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. \n","However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \n","binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, \n","whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the \n","FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has \n","announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a \n","desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly \n","liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might \n","exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is \n","possible. \n","To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important \n","financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal \n","banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, \n","maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to \n","absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal \n","banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the \n","continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding \n","the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on \n","parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging \n","institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital \n","and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an \n","orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to \n","facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, \n","2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended \n","and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with \n","WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and \n","subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo \n","Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC \n","(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated \n","from time to time as material entities for resolution planning \n","purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time \n","as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related \n","Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the \n","Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including \n","the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and \n","intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its \n","subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will \n","continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time \n","to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, \n","the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide \n","capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered \n","Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support \n","Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the \n","Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of \n","credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected \n","to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating \n","conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its \n","debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other \n","obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these \n","arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ \n","or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s \n","board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. \n","Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the \n","committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to \n","pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which \n","could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and \n","its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could \n","result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the \n","Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if \n","the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective \n","obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, \n","the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant \n","to a related security agreement. \n","In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \n","periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a \n","range of options that we may consider during times of \n","idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial \n","weaknesses and restore market confidence without \n","extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","57 \n","possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan \n","portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and \n","periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the \n","Bank’s plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is \n","experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has \n","not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution \n","is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our \n","recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on \n","our business or ultimately require us to divest assets. \n","Other Regulatory Related Matters \n","• \n","Regulatory actions.  The Company is subject to a number of \n","consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may \n","require the Company, among other things, to undertake \n","certain changes to its business, operations, products and \n","services, and risk management practices, and include the \n","following: \n","◦ \n","Consent Orders Discussed in the “Overview” Section in this \n","Report.  For a discussion of certain consent orders \n","applicable to the Company, see the “Overview” section \n","in this Report. \n","◦ \n","OCC approval of director and senior executive officer \n","appointments and certain post-termination payments.  \n","Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, \n","Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements \n","that were originally imposed in November 2016 to \n","provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-\n","objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in \n","directors and senior executive officers, and remains \n","subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-\n","termination payments to certain individuals and \n","employees. \n","• \n","Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change.  \n","Federal, state, and non-U.S. governments and government \n","agencies have demonstrated increased attention to the \n","impacts and potential risks associated with climate change. \n","For example, federal banking regulators are reviewing the \n","implications of climate change on the financial stability of \n","the United States and have issued guidance on the \n","identification and management by large banks of climate-\n","related financial risks. In addition, the SEC has proposed \n","rules that would require public companies to disclose certain \n","climate-related information, including greenhouse gas \n","emissions, climate-related targets and goals, and \n","governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk \n","management processes. Similarly, California’s state \n","legislature finalized climate-related disclosure laws, while \n","the European Union finalized its Corporate Sustainability \n","Reporting Directive. The approaches taken by various \n","governments and government agencies can vary \n","significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any \n","current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to \n","climate change and its impacts could require us to change \n","certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and \n","earnings, impose additional costs on us, subject us to legal or \n","regulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our \n","business operations and/or competitive position. \n","Regulatory Matters (continued) \n","58 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Critical Accounting Policies \n","Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of \n","Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of \n","operations and financial condition because they require that we \n","use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our \n","assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are \n","critical because they require management to make difficult, \n","subjective and complex judgments about matters that are \n","inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially \n","different amounts would be reported under different conditions \n","or using different assumptions. These policies govern: \n","• \n","the allowance for credit losses; \n","• \n","the valuation of residential MSRs; \n","• \n","the fair value of financial instruments; \n","• \n","income taxes; \n","• \n","liability for legal actions; and \n","• \n","goodwill impairment. \n","Management has discussed these critical accounting policies \n","and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit \n","Committee. \n","Allowance for Credit Losses \n","We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which \n","is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the \n","loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance \n","sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments \n","carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an \n","ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other \n","financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in \n","leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For \n","additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \n","Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance \n","for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured \n","based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset \n","(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as \n","appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options \n","using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted \n","information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a \n","discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference \n","between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. \n","Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision \n","for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the \n","judgment and review required to determine the ACL, \n","management considerations include the evaluation of past \n","events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and \n","conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the \n","initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to \n","time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business or \n","investment strategy, or products or product mix may result in a \n","corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our \n","methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial \n","asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio \n","segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available \n","to absorb credit losses of the Company. \n","Judgment is specifically applied in: \n","• \n","Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast \n","period.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to \n","estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables \n","include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, \n","and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic \n","variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some \n","economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, \n","for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for \n","unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real \n","estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the \n","initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period \n","to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast \n","multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base \n","scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more \n","pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises \n","judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios \n","that are used to estimate future credit losses. \n","• \n","Reversion to historical loss expectations.  Our long-term \n","average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the \n","long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the \n","forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages \n","are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. \n","The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is \n","assessed on a quarterly basis. \n","• \n","Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, \n","unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually \n","assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit \n","variables in our modeled approaches to help assess \n","probability of default and loss given default. Borrower \n","quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial \n","strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default \n","curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted \n","collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted \n","severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk \n","ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers \n","and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk \n","specialists. \n","• \n","Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally \n","developed models that incorporate credit attributes and \n","economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. \n","Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in \n","the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and \n","variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are \n","independently validated in accordance with the Company’s \n","policies. We routinely assess our model performance and \n","apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy \n","of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations \n","against the company-wide risk inventory to help \n","appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our \n","estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as \n","needed. \n","• \n","Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is \n","utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial \n","asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply \n","judgment when valuing the collateral either through \n","appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or \n","other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral \n","valuations support incremental ACL or charge-downs and \n","increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a \n","negative allowance when the financial asset has been \n","previously written-down below current recovery value. \n","• \n","Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual \n","term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and \n","certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We \n","extend the contractual term when we are not able to \n","unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension \n","options. Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","59 \n","which requires that we determine a contractual life by \n","estimating the application of future payments to the \n","outstanding loan amount. \n","• \n","Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in \n","the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s \n","judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions \n","used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic \n","environmental factors, modeling assumptions and \n","performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, \n","including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \n","Sensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key \n","assumptions which requires significant management judgment. \n","Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of \n","factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality, \n","and general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted \n","economic variables used could have varying impacts on different \n","financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous \n","credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variables \n","such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which \n","may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in \n","opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. \n","Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s \n","view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We \n","applied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our \n","sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic \n","deterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the \n","duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables \n","within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a \n","hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately \n","$6.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The hypothetical increase in \n","our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of \n","management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the \n","current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative \n","effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar \n","sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. \n","The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities \n","and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall \n","ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for \n","loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. \n","Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights \n","(MSRs) \n","MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage \n","loans for others. We generally recognize MSRs when we retain \n","servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of \n","loans we originate. We carry our MSRs related to residential \n","mortgage loans at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential \n","MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential \n","MSRs are reflected in earnings. \n","We use models to estimate the fair value of our residential \n","MSRs. The models are independently validated in accordance \n","with Company policies. Collectively, the models are used to \n","calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing \n","income and incorporate inputs and assumptions that market \n","participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs \n","and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and \n","require judgment to determine. If observable market indications \n","do become available, these are factored into the estimates as \n","appropriate. Significant inputs and assumptions requiring \n","management judgement include: \n","• \n","The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future \n","net servicing income.  The prepayment rate is the annual rate \n","at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage \n","loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower \n","defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and \n","borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in \n","mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. \n","• \n","The discount rate used to present value estimated future net \n","servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of \n","return investors in the market would expect for an asset \n","with similar risk and is estimated using a dynamic \n","methodology for market curves and volatility. To determine \n","the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for \n","uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from \n","servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future \n","servicing costs and earnings on escrow accounts). \n","• \n","The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net \n","servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes \n","estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency \n","and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of \n","defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service \n","loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market \n","participant’s view for our estimated cost to service and our \n","actual costs may vary from that estimate. \n","Both prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, \n","and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and \n","mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in \n","either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results \n","in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in \n","either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of \n","the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-\n","driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount \n","rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the \n","future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in \n","servicing standards as well as changes in individual state \n","foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant \n","information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an \n","impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation \n","in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value \n","estimate to independent appraisals. \n","For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, \n","see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 \n","(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets \n","and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \n","Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Fair Value of Financial Instruments \n","Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a \n","financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly \n","transaction between market participants at the measurement \n","date. \n","We use fair value measurements to comply with both \n","recognition and disclosure requirements. For example, assets and \n","liabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, \n","AFS debt securities, and derivatives are recorded at fair value on \n","our consolidated balance sheet each period. Other financial \n","instruments, such as loans held for investment and substantially \n","all nonmarketable equity securities are not recorded at fair value \n","each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments \n","through the application of an accounting method such as lower \n","of cost or fair value (LOCOM), write-downs of individual assets, \n","or application of the measurement alternative for certain \n","nonmarketable equity securities. We also disclose our estimate \n","of fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, \n","such as HTM debt securities, loans held for investment, and long-\n","term debt. \n","Disclosure of fair value measurements for assets and \n","liabilities are made using a three-level hierarchy. The \n","Critical Accounting Policies (continued) \n","60 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based \n","on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for \n","measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs \n","reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained \n","from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our \n","estimates about market data. \n","When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the \n","use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \n","inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to \n","measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not \n","available, fair value measurement is based upon models that \n","generally use market-based or independently sourced market \n","parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment \n","rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when \n","observable market data is limited or not available, fair value \n","estimates are typically determined using internal models based \n","on unobservable inputs. These models are independently \n","validated in accordance with the Company’s policies. Additionally, \n","we obtain pricing information from third-party vendors to record \n","fair values and to corroborate internal prices. Third-party \n","validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of \n","prices received. \n","When using internal models based on unobservable inputs, \n","management judgment is necessary as we make judgments \n","about significant assumptions that market participants would \n","use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions \n","includes consideration of many factors, including market \n","conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, \n","such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in \n","secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and \n","reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine \n","fair value. In such cases, adjustments to available quoted prices or \n","observable market data may be required. For example, we may \n","adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using \n","internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact \n","of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair \n","value measurement. \n","We continually assess the level and volume of market \n","activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining \n","adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions \n","can change over time, our determination of which securities \n","markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we \n","determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted \n","prices require adjustment may also change. \n","Significant judgment is also applied in the determination of \n","whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as \n","Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this \n","judgment, we consider available information, including \n","observable market data, indications of market liquidity and \n","orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques \n","and significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The \n","classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts \n","and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category \n","and judgments are made regarding the significance of \n","unobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value \n","measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \n","considered significant to the fair value measurement, the \n","instrument is classified as Level 3. \n","Table 48 presents our (i) assets and liabilities recorded at fair \n","value on a recurring basis and (ii) Level 3 assets and liabilities \n","recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, both presented as a \n","percentage of our total assets and total liabilities. \n","Table 48: Fair Value Level 3 Summary \n","December 31, 2023 \n","December 31, 2022 \n","($ in billions) \n","Total \n","balance \n","Level 3 (1) \n","Total \n","balance \n","Level 3 (1) \n","Assets recorded at fair \n","value on a recurring \n","basis \n","$ 276.2 \n","9.5 \n","264.4 \n","11.5 \n","As a percentage \n","of total assets \n","14 % \n","* \n","14 \n","* \n","Liabilities recorded at fair \n","value on a recurring \n","basis \n","$ \n","47.7 \n","6.2 \n","41.9 \n","4.9 \n","As a percentage of \n","total liabilities \n"," 3 % \n","* \n"," 2 \n","* \n","* \n","Less than 1%. \n","(1) \n","Before derivative netting adjustments. \n","See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion on \n","our fair value of financial instruments, our related measurement \n","techniques and the impact to our financial statements. \n","Income Taxes \n","We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we \n","operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: \n","current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax \n","expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded \n","for the current period and includes income tax expense related to \n","uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the \n","more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to \n","determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax \n","position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that \n","management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of \n","realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our \n","realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \n","Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \n","method and deferred income tax expense results from changes \n","in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the \n","balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is \n","based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and \n","tax basis of assets and liabilities and recognizes enacted changes \n","in income tax rates and laws in the period in which they \n","occur. Deferred tax assets, including those related to net \n","operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, are recognized \n","subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely \n","than not. When necessary, valuation allowances are established \n","to reduce deferred tax assets to the realizable amounts. \n","The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate \n","are complex and subject to different interpretations by \n","management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In \n","establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make \n","judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax \n","laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future \n","certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax \n","jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review \n","during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise \n","over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these \n","disputes during the tax examination and audit process and \n","ultimately through the court systems when applicable. \n","We monitor relevant tax authorities and may update our \n","estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax \n","laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory \n","authorities on a quarterly basis. Updates to our estimate of \n","accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax \n","planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. \n","Such updates to our estimates may be material to our operating \n","results for any given quarter. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","61 \n","See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes \n","and related income tax assets and liabilities. \n","Liability for Legal Actions \n","The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, \n","governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or \n","investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its \n","business activities, and many of those proceedings and \n","investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss or \n","other adverse consequences. We establish accruals for legal \n","actions when potential losses associated with the actions \n","become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For \n","such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best \n","estimate within a range of potential losses that are both \n","probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best \n","estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those \n","potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may \n","be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for \n","those actions. \n","We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for \n","potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing \n","the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. \n","Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of \n","reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for \n","probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding \n","of information currently available related to the legal evaluation \n","and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on \n","these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and \n","senior management. These matters may be in various stages of \n","investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a \n","wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and \n","jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was \n","not considered or was considered remote in anticipated \n","occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will \n","change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. \n","The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject \n","to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to \n","determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also \n","inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there \n","may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably \n","possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses \n","may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of \n","reasonably possible loss. \n","See Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report for additional information. \n","Goodwill Impairment \n","We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or \n","more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors \n","warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-\n","term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue \n","generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by \n","regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in \n","market capitalization. \n","We identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill \n","impairment at the reportable operating segment level or one \n","level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as \n","allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible \n","assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-\n","sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital \n","requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units \n","based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using \n","both an income approach and a market approach which are \n","intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as \n","well as external market conditions. The methodologies for \n","calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are \n","periodically assessed by senior management and updated as \n","necessary. \n","The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) \n","analysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows \n","associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires \n","significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our \n","reporting units, which includes future expectations of economic \n","conditions and balance sheet changes, as well as considerations \n","related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed \n","by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, \n","we incorporate a terminal value estimate. We discount these \n","forecasted cash flows using a consistent rate derived from the \n","capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of \n","equity for our reporting units, reflecting risks and uncertainties in \n","the financial markets and in our internally generated business \n","projections. \n","The market approach utilizes observable market data from \n","comparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings \n","or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting \n","unit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a \n","control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical \n","acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in \n","the selection of comparable companies and includes those with \n","the most similar business activities. \n","The aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our \n","market capitalization for our fourth quarter 2023 assessment. \n","Factors that we believe contributed to this difference included an \n","overall premium that would be paid to gain control of the \n","operating and financial decisions of the Company, as well as \n","short-term market volatility and other factors that may not be \n","reflected consistently between the Company’s market \n","capitalization and the fair value of individual reporting units. \n","Based on our fourth quarter 2023 assessment, there was no \n","impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2023. The fair values of \n","each reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts by \n","substantial amounts, with the exception of our Consumer \n","Lending reporting unit. Although the fair value of our Consumer \n","Lending reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by more \n","than 10%, it was the most sensitive to changes in valuation \n","assumptions. We plan to continue the execution of our more \n","focused strategy for the home lending business in the near-term. \n","The credit card business has forecasted higher loan balances \n","driven by growth from new products and services. Significant \n","changes to these plans or forecasts or a significant increase in the \n","discount rate could result in an impairment for the Consumer \n","Lending reporting unit.

We discuss below \n","risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and \n","condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the \n","Company. \n","ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND \n","LIQUIDITY RISKS \n","Our financial results have been, and will continue to be, \n","materially affected by general economic conditions, and a \n","deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial \n","markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other \n","businesses and our financial results and condition.  We \n","generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the \n","loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial \n","amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest \n","income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and \n","commercial lending and banking businesses. These businesses \n","have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the \n","state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and \n","home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty \n","stemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, \n","including concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes, \n","and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact \n","the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including \n","international political unrest or disturbances, wars, and terrorist \n","activities, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices, \n","restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliatory \n","measures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the \n","stability of financial markets and the global economy. Any \n","impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to the \n","U.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global \n","economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions \n","and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or \n","any other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the U.S. \n","or global economy, could materially adversely affect our \n","financial results and condition. \n","A weakening in business or economic conditions, including \n","higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as \n","higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers’ \n","ability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can \n","increase our credit losses. If unemployment levels worsen or if \n","home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs \n","and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit \n","losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer \n","loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially \n","for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries \n","that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The \n","ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may \n","deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE \n","lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In \n","addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it \n","more challenging for us to increase our consumer and \n","commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy \n","borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic \n","conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest \n","rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our \n","retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on \n","our consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions worsen \n","and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a \n","decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the \n","demand for our products, including our consumer and \n","commercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest \n","income and our earnings. \n","A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which \n","may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or \n","increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely \n","affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our \n","investment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, \n","markets and investment banking businesses. For example, \n","because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of \n","assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those \n","assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market \n","prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing \n","commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage \n","business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively \n","affect the performance of products we have provided to \n","customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional \n","costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial \n","markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity \n","underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture \n","capital business and trading activities, including through \n","increased counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global \n","financial markets and economies, including as a result of any \n","geopolitical matters or unrest, may adversely affect the revenue \n","and earnings of our international operations, particularly our \n","global financial institution and correspondent banking services. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” \n","sections in this Report. \n","Changes in interest rates and financial market values could \n","reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our \n","other comprehensive income, including as a result of \n","recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we \n","hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in \n","either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning \n","assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the \n","February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net \n","interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can \n","affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our \n","assets and the funding costs of our liabilities tend to move in the \n","same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can \n","rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin \n","to expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the \n","yield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets \n","falls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin tends \n","to contract. \n","The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect \n","our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the \n","form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. \n","As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower \n","demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield \n","and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and \n","net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged \n","period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower \n","yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, \n","particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher \n","yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. A prolonged \n","period of high interest rates, however, may continue to \n","negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit \n","66 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher \n","interest payments. Similarly, a prolonged period of high interest \n","rates may increase our funding costs, including the rates we pay \n","on customer deposits. As described below, changes in interest \n","rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of \n","our MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB \n","significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate over \n","the last two years, however, the FRB could decide to further raise \n","it or lower it in 2024. \n","Changes in the slope of the yield curve – or the spread \n","between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also \n","reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. \n","Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term \n","rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve \n","flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest \n","margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding \n","increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term \n","assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which \n","interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest \n","income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the \n","interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while \n","also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with \n","the FRB. \n","We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on \n","our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on \n","assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of \n","interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may \n","hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate \n","derivatives. We also experience the somewhat offsetting effect \n","that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can \n","provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite \n","directions based on changes in interest rates. \n","We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There \n","is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or \n","option volatility could reduce our net interest income and \n","earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material \n","amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially \n","different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates \n","rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve \n","changes, we may experience significant losses, including \n","unrealized losses, on debt securities in our portfolio. To reduce \n","our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt \n","securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic \n","actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In \n","addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis \n","risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. \n","We have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as \n","commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, \n","debt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to benchmark \n","rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or \n","other financial metrics. If any such benchmark rate or other \n","referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or \n","discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market \n","benchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or \n","differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or \n","payment amount depending on the terms of the governing \n","instrument. This could impact the financial performance of \n","previously recorded transactions, result in losses on financial \n","instruments we hold, require different hedging strategies or \n","result in ineffective or increased basis risk on existing hedges, \n","impact the overall interest rate environment and the availability \n","or cost of funding transactions, affect our capital and liquidity \n","planning and management, or have other adverse financial \n","consequences. It may also result in significant operational, \n","systems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and \n","operational costs, legal or regulatory proceedings, reputational \n","harm, or other adverse consequences. Because of changing \n","economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, \n","affecting issuers and the performance of any underlying \n","collateral, we may be required to recognize impairment in future \n","periods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the \n","debt securities we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest \n","rates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income \n","also is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, \n","foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in \n","connection with our trading activities, which are conducted \n","primarily to accommodate the investment and risk management \n","activities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic \n","hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt \n","securities and equity securities held for trading are carried at fair \n","value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in \n","noninterest income. As part of our business to support our \n","customers, we trade public debt and equity securities and other \n","financial instruments that are subject to market fluctuations with \n","gains and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although \n","high market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-\n","related losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse \n","effect on our businesses as a result of reduced customer activity \n","levels. Although we have processes in place to measure and \n","monitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including \n","stress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance \n","that our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding \n","losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial \n","results. \n","The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity \n","securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable \n","equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and \n","losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are \n","carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement \n","alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized \n","gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity \n","securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may \n","have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. \n","When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of \n","factors, including general economic and market conditions, the \n","prospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company \n","goes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, \n","and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. \n","Nonmarketable equity securities include our venture capital \n","and private equity investments that could result in significant \n","impairment losses for those investments carried under the \n","measurement alternative or equity method. If we recognize an \n","impairment for an investment, we write-down the carrying value \n","of the investment to fair value, resulting in a charge to earnings, \n","which could be significant. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk,” “– Mortgage \n","Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk,” “– Market Risk – Trading \n","Activities,” and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the \n","“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\n","Maturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 2 \n","(Trading Activities), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\n","Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 4 (Equity Securities) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation \n","of our business, and our financial results and condition could be \n","materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage \n","our liquidity. We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a \n","low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","67 \n","the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, \n","our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, \n","our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to \n","pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the \n","FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and \n","international money through capital markets. \n","Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business \n","could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions \n","and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and \n","volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial \n","markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial \n","crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of \n","customer deposits, outflows of cash or collateral, an inability to \n","access capital markets on favorable terms, or other adverse \n","effects on our liquidity and funding. The financial system also \n","experienced disruption and volatility in early 2023 due to the \n","failure of several banks, and episodes of disruption, volatility or \n","other adverse market conditions may continue to occur if there \n","are additional instances of actual or threatened bank failures. \n","Market disruption and volatility could also impact our credit \n","spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of \n","U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the \n","same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. \n","Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could \n","significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and \n","factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and \n","funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the \n","Company or negative news about the Company or the financial \n","services industry generally which also may result in a loss of \n","deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital \n","markets; any inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; \n","disruptions or volatility in the market for securities repurchase \n","agreements, or any inability to effectively access the market for \n","securities repurchase agreements, which also may increase our \n","short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or \n","restrictions, including changes to regulatory capital or liquidity \n","requirements; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws \n","on lines of credit; any inability to access secured borrowing \n","facilities through the FHLB or FRB, or any negative perception in \n","the market created by accessing these facilities; and, as described \n","below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of \n","the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over \n","which we have little or no control. Similarly, the speed with which \n","information is disseminated and the speed with which customers \n","can withdraw funds in response to information may also \n","contribute to a faster and greater loss of deposits, particularly \n","uninsured or non-operational deposits, as well as other adverse \n","effects on liquidity or funding, similar to what contributed to the \n","failure of several banks in early 2023. There can be no assurance \n","that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets \n","will not occur in the future. For example, concerns over \n","geopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as \n","global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility. \n","In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels, \n","including any potential failure to raise the debt limit, and any \n","associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may \n","cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the \n","sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt \n","ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as \n","well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing \n","economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely \n","affect the market value of the U.S. government securities or \n","federal agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that we hold, \n","the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and \n","our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as \n","have other material adverse effects on the operation of our \n","business and our financial results and condition. \n","As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our \n","funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial \n","services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the \n","rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either \n","because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we \n","lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of \n","funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms \n","of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive \n","other investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money \n","market mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. \n","When customers move money out of bank deposits and into \n","other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of \n","funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our \n","liquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit \n","balances in order to manage under the asset cap. \n","If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through \n","customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms, \n","if there are changes to our regulatory capital or liquidity \n","requirements, or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs \n","or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on \n","an intra-day or intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest \n","margin, and financial results and condition may be materially \n","adversely affected. As we did during the financial crisis in 2009, \n","we may also need, or be required by our regulators, to raise \n","additional capital through the issuance of common stock, which \n","could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or \n","even eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve capital or \n","to raise additional capital. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report. \n","Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material \n","adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, and financial results \n","and condition. Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding \n","are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of \n","our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow \n","funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and \n","could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise \n","collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely \n","affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit \n","ratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ \n","analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, including \n","our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the \n","level and quality of our earnings, and rating agency assumptions \n","regarding the probability and extent of federal financial \n","assistance or support. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing \n","costs are affected by various other external factors, including \n","market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial \n","services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we \n","will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit \n","ratings downgrades in the future would not have a material \n","adverse effect on our ability to borrow funds and borrowing \n","costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger \n","additional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on \n","the severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse \n","effect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related \n","contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. \n","For information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk \n","Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and \n","Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding \n","additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain \n","derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","68 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","below investment grade, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial \n","Statements in this Report. \n","We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and \n","federal and state law, regulatory requirements, and certain \n","contractual arrangements can limit those dividends.  Wells \n","Fargo & Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is \n","a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It \n","receives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from \n","dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We \n","generally use these dividends and distributions, among other \n","things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and \n","interest and principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit \n","the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and \n","some of our nonbank subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer \n","subsidiaries, may pay to the Parent. Similarly, as part of their \n","supervisory authority, regulators may limit or restrict subsidiary \n","capital distributions. In addition, as part of our resolution \n","planning efforts, we have entered into a Support Agreement \n","dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, \n","among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding \n","company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo \n","Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo \n","Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the \n","Parent designated from time to time as material entities for \n","resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as \n","related support entities in our resolution plan, pursuant to which \n","the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the \n","Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined \n","triggers or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a \n","case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also, our right to \n","participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s \n","liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the \n","subsidiary’s creditors. \n","For additional information, see the “Regulation and \n","Supervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company \n","Structure” sections in our 2023 Form 10-K and the “Regulatory \n","Matters” section and Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements \n","and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","REGULATORY RISKS \n","Current and future legislation and/or regulation could require \n","us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our \n","revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or \n","otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or \n","competitive position.  Our parent company, our subsidiary \n","banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those \n","related to our brokerage business, are subject to significant and \n","extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as \n","well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of \n","the U.S. where they conduct business. These regulations \n","generally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, \n","consumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial \n","system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. \n","Economic, market and political conditions during the past few \n","years have led to a significant amount of legislation and \n","regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services \n","industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of \n","financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws \n","and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we \n","do business and the products and services that we provide, affect \n","or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our \n","ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our \n","revenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, \n","limit subsidiary capital distributions, increase our capital or \n","liquidity requirements, impose additional fines or assessments \n","on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial \n","services industry, and adversely affect our business operations or \n","have other negative consequences. Our businesses and revenue \n","in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject to risks from political, \n","economic and social developments in those jurisdictions, \n","including sanctions or business restrictions, asset freezes or \n","confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic developments, or \n","financial or social instability. In addition, changes to tax laws, \n","regulations, and guidance may negatively impact our effective \n","income tax rate, financial results, or the amount of any tax assets \n","or liabilities. Furthermore, greater government oversight and \n","scrutiny of Wells Fargo, as well as financial services companies \n","generally, has increased our operational and compliance costs as \n","we must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing \n","our procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory \n","standards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory \n","requirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in \n","non-U.S. jurisdictions, could continue to result in significant fines, \n","penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, reputational \n","harm, or other adverse consequences. \n","Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, \n","credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending \n","businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly \n","complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as \n","enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory \n","examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB’s \n","rules and requirements may continue to increase our compliance \n","costs, limit the fees we can charge for certain products and \n","services, and require changes in our business practices, which \n","could limit or negatively affect our earnings as well as the \n","products and services that we offer our customers. If we fail to \n","meet enhanced regulatory requirements and expectations with \n","respect to our consumer businesses, we may be subject to \n","increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business \n","activities including the products and services we can provide, \n","reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. \n","In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a \n","comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter \n","derivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory \n","agencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based \n","swaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to \n","negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter \n","derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives \n","or amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for \n","engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives \n","activities. \n","We are also subject to various rules and regulations related \n","to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, \n","including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These rules and \n","regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies \n","and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery \n","and corruption, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, \n","currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. \n","Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply \n","with these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully \n","effective or do not meet regulatory standards or expectations, \n","we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain \n","business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse \n","consequences. \n","Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations \n","enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental \n","authorities relating to the privacy of the information of \n","customers, employees and others. These laws and regulations, \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","69 \n","among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a \n","significant impact on our businesses’ collection, processing, \n","sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data \n","breaches; and provide for significant penalties for non-\n","compliance. \n","In addition, we are subject to a number of consent orders \n","and other regulatory actions, including a February 2018 consent \n","order with the FRB regarding the Board’s governance and \n","oversight of the Company, and the Company’s compliance and \n","operational risk management program. This consent order limits \n","the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the \n","consent order to the level as of December 31, 2017, until certain \n","conditions are met. This limitation could continue to adversely \n","affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also \n","subject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC \n","regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program \n","and past practices involving certain automobile collateral \n","protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate \n","lock extensions. In addition, we are subject to a September 2021 \n","consent order with the OCC regarding loss mitigation activities in \n","the Company’s Home Lending business. Similarly, we are subject \n","to a December 2022 consent order with the CFPB regarding \n","multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer \n","deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. We are also subject to \n","older consent orders including dating back to 2011. Addressing \n","these and other regulatory actions is expected to take multiple \n","years, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays \n","along the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely \n","to continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and \n","control infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory \n","actions. \n","Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank \n","remains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in \n","November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain \n","non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors \n","and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain \n","regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain \n","individuals and employees. \n","The Company may be subject to further actions, including \n","the imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory \n","agreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators \n","regarding similar or other issues. Regulators have indicated the \n","potential for escalating consequences for banks that do not \n","timely resolve open issues or have repeat issues. Furthermore, \n","issues or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory \n","action could affect our progress on others. Failure to satisfy the \n","requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result \n","in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, limitations on \n","subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or liquidity \n","requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse \n","consequences, which could be significant. For example, in \n","September 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money \n","penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in \n","addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent \n","order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home \n","Lending business. Compliance with the February 2018 FRB \n","consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, the \n","September 2021 OCC consent order, the December 2022 CFPB \n","consent order, older consent orders including dating back to \n","2011, and any other consent orders or regulatory actions, as well \n","as the implementation of their requirements, may continue to \n","increase the Company’s costs, require the Company to reallocate \n","resources away from growing its existing businesses, subject the \n","Company to business restrictions, negatively impact the \n","Company’s capital and liquidity, require the Company to undergo \n","significant changes to its business, operations, products and \n","services, and risk management practices, and subject the \n","Company to other adverse consequences. For additional \n","information on the Company’s consent orders, see the \n","“Overview” section in this Report. \n","Any future legislation, rule and/or regulation also could \n","significantly change our regulatory environment, increase our \n","cost of doing business, limit the activities we may pursue, affect \n","the competitive balance among banks and other financial \n","services companies, and have a material adverse effect on our \n","financial results and condition. \n","For additional information on the significant regulations and \n","regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect \n","our business, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this Report \n","and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2023 Form \n","10-K. \n","We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or \n","liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities \n","or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or \n","recovery plan is deficient.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB \n","and the FDIC, Wells Fargo prepares and periodically submits \n","resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” designed to facilitate \n","our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial \n","distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or \n","FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution plans. \n","If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that a resolution plan has \n","deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or \n","liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or \n","operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the \n","FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable \n","to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain \n","assets or operations. \n","In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \n","periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a \n","range of options that we may consider during times of \n","idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any \n","financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without \n","extraordinary government support. The Bank must also prepare \n","and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan. If either the \n","FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, \n","they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately \n","require us to divest assets. \n","Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of \n","Wells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full. \n","If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \n","proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \n","regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly \n","liquidation authority,” which allows for the appointment of the \n","FDIC as receiver. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires \n","that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses \n","before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are \n","substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the \n","orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, \n","including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of \n","creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain \n","circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure \n","instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. \n","The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \n","a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \n","only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. \n","However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \n","binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo. \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","70 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","To facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, we \n","entered into the Support Agreement, pursuant to which the \n","Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets to the IHC \n","and will continue to transfer assets to the IHC from time to time. \n","In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC \n","will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital \n","and/or liquidity to the Bank and certain other direct and indirect \n","subsidiaries of the Parent. Under the Support Agreement, the \n","IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through \n","subordinated notes and a committed line of credit. If certain \n","liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if \n","the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under \n","the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be \n","forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the \n","IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, \n","any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s \n","liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, \n","and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy \n","proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have \n","otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not \n","implemented. \n","Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on \n","shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of the \n","Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. \n","Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive \n","significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Parent’s \n","security holders could face significant or complete losses. This \n","outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the \n","U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly \n","liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted \n","using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple point of \n","entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its \n","subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution \n","proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multiple \n","point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiaries \n","could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s \n","security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy proved \n","to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater losses \n","than if the strategy had not been implemented. \n","For additional information, see the “Regulatory Matters – \n","‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this \n","Report. \n","Regulatory rules and requirements may impose higher capital \n","and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock \n","dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our \n","business, or provide loans or other products and services to our \n","customers.  The Company and each of our insured depository \n","institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy \n","requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In \n","particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal \n","banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital \n","requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, \n","among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating \n","capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal \n","banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a \n","supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and \n","our insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized \n","rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term \n","debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and \n","resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity \n","(TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued final \n","rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable \n","funding ratio. \n","In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced \n","capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms \n","pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital \n","plan rule that establishes capital planning and other \n","requirements that govern capital distributions, including \n","dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \n","Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations \n","implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs \n","like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk \n","and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and \n","imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators \n","determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the \n","United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules \n","implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and \n","national banks. Furthermore, the FRB has established \n","expectations regarding effective boards of directors of large \n","BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has also established \n","heightened governance and risk management standards for large \n","national banks, such as the Bank. \n","The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, \n","liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may \n","limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including \n","common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require \n","us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that \n","we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or \n","liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, \n","such as from the adoption of the current proposal to revise the \n","Basel standards in the U.S., changes in regulatory interpretations \n","regarding risk-weighted asset calculation methodologies, \n","including the impact from securitizations of credit risk, or as a \n","result of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk \n","profile, could increase our funding costs, reduce our flexibility to \n","source and deploy funding, or require us to liquidate assets or \n","otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or \n","investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial \n","results. Although not currently anticipated, new capital \n","requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise \n","additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock \n","may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, \n","federal banking regulations may continue to increase our \n","compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our \n","business or provide loans or other products and services to our \n","customers. \n","For additional information, see the “Capital Management,” \n","“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk \n","and Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” \n","sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” \n","section in our 2023 Form 10-K. \n","FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can \n","significantly affect business and economic conditions and our \n","financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of \n","money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part \n","our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we \n","earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our \n","net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest \n","rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial \n","instruments we hold, such as debt securities. In addition, its \n","policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk \n","that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies, \n","including its target range for the federal funds rate or actions \n","taken to increase or decrease the size of its balance sheet, are \n","beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB \n","significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate over \n","the last two years to address high inflation, however, the FRB \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","71 \n","could decide to further raise it or lower it in 2024. As noted \n","above, changes in the interest rate environment and yield curve \n","which may result from the FRB’s actions could negatively affect \n","our net interest income and net interest margin. \n","CREDIT RISKS \n","Increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in \n","economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could \n","require us to increase our provision for credit losses and \n","allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse \n","effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n","When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit \n","risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. \n","As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance \n","of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results \n","and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading \n","and other activities. As noted above, if the economic \n","environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and \n","counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or \n","other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit \n","losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses \n","by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The \n","amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of expected \n","credit losses over the anticipated life of our loan portfolio \n","(including unfunded credit commitments). The process for \n","determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our \n","financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective, and \n","complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of \n","economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of \n","our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the \n","allowance because of changing economic conditions, including \n","falling home or commercial real estate values, higher \n","unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in \n","consumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely \n","affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory \n","environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, \n","disease pandemics such as COVID-19, political or social matters, \n","or trade policies, also can continue to influence recognition of \n","credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for \n","credit losses. \n","Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a \n","variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit \n","quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic \n","conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses \n","was appropriate at December 31, 2023, there is no assurance \n","that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event \n","of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we \n","experience significant loan growth, we may be required to \n","increase the allowance in future periods, which would reduce our \n","earnings. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – \n","Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. \n","We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the \n","extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry \n","segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or \n","collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our \n","loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or \n","similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group \n","may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or \n","market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market \n","conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or \n","geography may also impact related or dependent industries or \n","the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in \n","such industries to meet their financial obligations. We \n","experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 \n","when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential \n","real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater \n","than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in \n","many markets, including the Central Valley California market and \n","several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As \n","California is our largest banking state in terms of loans, \n","deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic \n","conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could \n","result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in \n","consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely \n","affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may \n","increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these \n","borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration \n","in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could \n","result in materially higher credit losses, including for our \n","residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes \n","nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. \n","We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as \n","our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their \n","contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize. \n","We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. \n","A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects \n","the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including \n","increases in interest rates and related refinancing risks at \n","maturity, declines in commercial property values, and/or changes \n","in consumer behavior or other market conditions, such as a \n","continued decrease in the demand for office space, could result in \n","materially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect \n","on our financial results and condition. \n","Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions \n","may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in \n","non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material \n","adverse effect on our credit performance and results of \n","operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively \n","affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. \n","operations. \n","Due to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain \n","derivative transactions through central counterparty \n","clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to these \n","CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we \n","may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the \n","CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults \n","on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of non-\n","performance by our clients for which we clear transactions \n","through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not \n","sufficiently covered by available collateral. \n","For additional information regarding credit risk, see the \n","“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section and \n","Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report. \n","OPERATIONAL, STRATEGIC, AND LEGAL RISKS \n","A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, \n","controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors \n","and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, \n","damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  As \n","a large financial institution that serves customers through \n","numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking \n","and other distribution channels across the U.S. and \n","internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and \n","monitor a large number of customer transactions on a \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","72 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have a \n","broad geographic footprint throughout the U.S. and \n","internationally, as we have increasingly used the internet and \n","mobile banking to provide products and services to our \n","customers, as customer, public, legislative and regulatory \n","expectations regarding operational and information security \n","have increased, and as cyber and other information security \n","attacks have become more prevalent and complex, our \n","operational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue \n","to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, \n","disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, \n","data processing systems or other operating systems and \n","facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based \n","on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged \n","as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly \n","or partially beyond our control. For example, there have been and \n","could in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction \n","volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation \n","or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural \n","disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease \n","pandemics such as COVID-19; events arising from local or larger \n","scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as \n","described below, cyber attacks or other information security \n","incidents. The COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could \n","result in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on \n","us or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already \n","experienced, including creating additional operational and \n","compliance risks, such as the need to comply with rapidly \n","changing regulatory requirements and to quickly implement new \n","measures to protect the functionality of our systems, networks, \n","and operations. \n","Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our \n","infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, \n","entail significant costs, and create risks associated with \n","implementing new systems and integrating them with existing \n","ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our \n","systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and \n","operating systems, including their security measures and \n","controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and \n","security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover \n","critical business processes or operations that have been \n","disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and \n","consequences of such disruptions. Although we have enterprise \n","incident response processes, business continuity plans and other \n","safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our \n","business operations may be adversely affected by significant and \n","widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating \n","systems that support our businesses and customers. For \n","example, we have experienced system issues caused by a variety \n","of factors that have resulted in intermittent service \n","interruptions, such as temporary disruptions to online and mobile \n","banking services, delays in posting transactions, and customer \n","difficulty signing into accounts. \n","As a result of financial institutions and technology systems \n","becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational \n","incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material \n","impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, \n","third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our \n","business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as \n","exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors \n","that provide services or security solutions for our operations, \n","could continue to be sources of operational risk to us, including \n","from information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or \n","failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies \n","in the performance of their responsibilities. These risks are \n","increased to the extent we rely on a single third party or on third \n","parties in a single geographic area. We are also exposed to the \n","risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common \n","service provider to our third parties could impede their ability to \n","provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In \n","addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and \n","expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, \n","and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their \n","obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, \n","regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, \n","restrictions on our business, or other adverse consequences. \n","Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls \n","or operating systems that support our businesses and \n","customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to \n","adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform \n","their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or \n","oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business \n","disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, remediation and other costs, violations of \n","applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, customer \n","harm, or other adverse consequences, any of which could \n","materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial \n","condition. \n","A cyber attack or other information security incident could \n","have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \n","financial condition, or reputation.  Information security risks for \n","large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally \n","increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of \n","new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and \n","cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the \n","increased prevalence and availability of artificial intelligence, the \n","increase in remote work arrangements, and the increased \n","sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, \n","terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign \n","state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to \n","attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to \n","commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or \n","attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other \n","users of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or \n","other information to gain access to our data or that of our \n","customers. Geopolitical matters may also elevate the risk of an \n","information security threat, particularly by foreign state-\n","sponsored parties or their supporters. As noted above, our \n","operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and \n","storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our \n","computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, \n","investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our \n","digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, \n","hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, \n","to access our products and services, our customers may use \n","personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are \n","beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, \n","software, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be \n","the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, \n","which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of \n","fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, \n","monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our \n","customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or \n","the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third \n","parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have \n","reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large \n","amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card \n","information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur \n","costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","73 \n","transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed \n","to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of \n","the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and \n","procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security \n","controls for personal gain or other improper purposes. \n","Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of \n","financial institutions and technology systems, an information \n","security incident at a third party or a third party’s downstream \n","service providers may increase the risk of loss or material impact \n","to us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties \n","(including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, \n","including those that facilitate our business activities or to which \n","we outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology, \n","hardware, software, and cloud service providers, continue to be \n","sources of information security risk to us. We could suffer \n","material harm, including business disruptions, losses or \n","remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, or other adverse consequences as a result of the \n","failure of those third parties to adequately or appropriately \n","safeguard their technologies, systems, networks, hardware, and \n","software, or as a result of our or our customers’ data being \n","compromised due to information security incidents affecting \n","those third parties. \n","Our risk and exposure to information security threats \n","remains heightened because of, among other things, the \n","persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent \n","size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services \n","industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and \n","mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote \n","connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how \n","they want to be served, our geographic footprint and \n","international presence, our use of third parties, the outsourcing \n","of some of our business operations, and the current global \n","economic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo \n","and other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service \n","providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and \n","adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, \n","malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to \n","exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential \n","validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to \n","disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their \n","cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, \n","proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also \n","focused on targeting online applications and services, such as \n","online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and \n","services provided by third parties, and have targeted the \n","infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread \n","unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As \n","a result, information security and the continued development \n","and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems \n","designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data \n","from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for \n","Wells Fargo. We are also involved in industry cybersecurity \n","efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party \n","service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to \n","enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security \n","threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to \n","continue to be required to expend significant resources to \n","develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate \n","and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or \n","incidents. Because the investigation of any information security \n","breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to \n","complete, we may not be able to immediately address the \n","consequences of a breach, which may further increase any \n","associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our \n","insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such \n","insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses \n","associated with an information security breach. \n","Cyber attacks or other information security incidents \n","affecting us or third parties (including their downstream service \n","providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our \n","business activities or to which we outsource operations, or \n","affecting the networks, systems or devices that our customers \n","use to access our products and services, could result in business \n","disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations \n","of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or \n","other adverse consequences, any of which could materially \n","adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \n","Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in \n","mitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework \n","seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established \n","processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, \n","monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are \n","subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest \n","rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and \n","reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk \n","management framework, there are inherent limitations to our \n","risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the \n","future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, \n","identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also \n","dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and an \n","appropriate risk mindset exist throughout the Company. The \n","inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the \n","appropriate culture throughout the Company, including the \n","inability to align performance management and compensation to \n","achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the \n","effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we \n","are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we \n","may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We \n","process a large number of transactions each day and could \n","continue to experience increased costs, regulatory investigations, \n","or other adverse consequences if we do not accurately or \n","completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to \n","human error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent \n","fraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service \n","provider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, \n","inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other \n","misconduct. \n","In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor \n","and predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and \n","credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, \n","there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or \n","sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future \n","events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are \n","subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to \n","meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, \n","penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, or other \n","adverse consequences, and any required modifications or \n","changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and \n","requirements and result in increased operational and compliance \n","costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our \n","various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with \n","the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our \n","aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could \n","result in ineffective risk management practices, business \n","decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or \n","inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","74 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or \n","automate certain business decisions, operations, and risk \n","management practices, as well as to improve our customer \n","service, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will \n","appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human \n","assessment or accurately predict future events or exposures. For \n","example, the algorithms or datasets underlying our artificial \n","intelligence may be inaccurate or include other weaknesses that \n","could result in deficient or biased data outputs or other \n","unintended consequences. Accordingly, even though we may \n","have controls, our use of artificial intelligence could result in \n","ineffective business decisions, operations, risk management \n","practices, or customer service, legal or regulatory proceedings, \n","reputational harm, or other adverse effects on our business or \n","financial results. \n","Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory \n","reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the \n","limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators \n","remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells \n","Fargo in particular, maintain risk management policies and \n","practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, \n","we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially \n","adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \n","We may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to \n","instances where customers may have experienced financial \n","harm.  We have identified and may in the future identify areas or \n","instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, \n","including as a result of our continuing efforts to strengthen our \n","risk and control infrastructure. For example, we identified certain \n","issues related to past practices involving certain automobile \n","collateral protection insurance policies and certain issues related \n","to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection \n","waiver or insurance agreements. We also previously entered into \n","settlements to resolve inquiries or investigations by various \n","government entities and lawsuits by non-government parties \n","arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company. \n","Negative publicity or public opinion resulting from instances \n","where customers may have experienced financial harm may \n","continue to increase the risk of reputational harm to our \n","business. Similarly, the identification of areas or instances where \n","customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, \n","and in some cases has already resulted in, significant remediation \n","costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, compliance and other costs, or other adverse \n","consequences. \n","For additional information, see the “Overview – Retail Sales \n","Practices Matters” and “Overview – Customer Remediation \n","Activities” sections in this Report. \n","We may incur fines, penalties, business restrictions, and other \n","adverse consequences from regulatory violations or from any \n","failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations.  We \n","maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we \n","comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are \n","subject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and \n","expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly \n","complex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject \n","to consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to \n","various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or \n","issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations \n","and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in \n","the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental \n","entities in different jurisdictions. Also, the laws and regulations in \n","jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even \n","conflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal \n","and state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to \n","the products and services we may offer or other business \n","activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance \n","difficulties or issues. Additionally, regulatory or compliance issues \n","at other financial institutions could result in regulatory scrutiny \n","for us. We could also be subject to regulatory actions, including \n","fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse \n","consequences, if we fail to obtain applicable licensing or \n","registration in any jurisdiction in which we offer our products and \n","services. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require \n","us to report transactions and other information to regulators and \n","other governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, \n","exchanges, clearing houses and customers. We may be subject to \n","fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse \n","consequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately \n","provide regulatory reports, customer notices, or disclosures. \n","Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for \n","the imposition of fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other \n","adverse consequences for noncompliance even though the \n","noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even \n","though there were systems and procedures in place at the time \n","designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to \n","regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control \n","(OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in \n","the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain \n","non-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. \n","OFAC may impose fines, penalties, or restrictions on certain \n","business activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations \n","even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the \n","violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or \n","regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or \n","any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, \n","including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent \n","orders or other regulatory actions, could result in significant \n","fines, penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, \n","negative impacts to our capital and liquidity, requirements to \n","undergo significant changes to our business, operations, \n","products and services, and risk management practices, \n","reputational harm, loss of customers, or other adverse \n","consequences. Furthermore, these consequences may escalate \n","to the extent issues are not timely resolved or are repeated. \n","Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged \n","conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry \n","generally, could adversely affect our business, results of \n","operations, and financial condition.  Reputation risk, or the risk \n","to our business, earnings and capital from negative public \n","opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased \n","substantially because of our size and profile in the financial \n","services industry, sales practices related matters, and instances \n","where customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative \n","public opinion about the financial services industry generally or \n","Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and \n","our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion \n","could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of \n","activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other \n","consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing \n","activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client \n","accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business \n","relationships; identification and management of potential \n","conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests \n","with and among our customers; environmental, social and \n","governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","75 \n","incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or \n","inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, \n","and from actions taken by government regulators and \n","community or other organizations in response to that conduct. \n","Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to \n","detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party \n","service providers that could potentially harm customers or our \n","reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and \n","procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. \n","Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or \n","prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our \n","business or operations could result in significant reputational \n","harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses \n","under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one \n","business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, \n","actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain \n","members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect \n","our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized \n","by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use \n","of social media by our employees and others, including personal \n","blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that \n","negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be \n","posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or \n","have other negative consequences, including as a result of our \n","employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized \n","manner in various social media outlets. \n","Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been \n","targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, \n","which have included disrupting the operation of our retail \n","banking locations, and have been subject to negative public \n","commentary, including with respect to certain business practices \n","and the fees charged for various products and services. Wells \n","Fargo and other financial institutions have also been subject to \n","negative publicity as a result of providing or reducing financial \n","services to or making investments in industries or organizations \n","subject to stakeholder concerns. There can be no assurance that \n","continued protests or negative public opinion of the Company \n","specifically or large financial institutions generally will not harm \n","our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of \n","operations, and financial condition. \n","If we are unable to develop and execute effective business \n","plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our \n","competitive standing and results of operations could suffer.  In \n","order to advance our business goals, we may undertake business \n","plans or strategies related to, among other things, our \n","organizational structure, our compliance and risk management \n","framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products \n","and services we offer, the types of businesses we engage in, the \n","geographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve \n","our clients and customers, the third parties with which we do \n","business, and the methods and distribution channels by which we \n","offer our products and services. Accomplishing these business \n","plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require \n","significant financial, technological, management and other \n","resources, may divert management attention and resources away \n","from other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses \n","and ability to generate revenue. There is no guarantee that any \n","business plans or strategies, including our current efficiency \n","initiatives, will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are \n","unable to develop or execute effective business plans or \n","strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive \n","position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of \n","operations may be adversely affected. \n","In addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest \n","certain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture \n","may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other \n","benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than \n","expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain \n","customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses \n","or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other \n","long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets, which \n","could adversely affect our financial results. \n","Similarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our \n","products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of \n","companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We \n","generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we \n","can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other \n","financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or \n","on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals \n","will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches \n","and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a \n","condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. \n","When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall \n","depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to \n","be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to \n","existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue \n","common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, \n","difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may \n","cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, \n","increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected \n","benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in \n","higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an \n","increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our \n","business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability \n","to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated \n","benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on \n","integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing \n","businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the \n","acquired company or business operates internationally or in a \n","geographic location where we do not already have significant \n","business operations and/or employees. \n","Our operations and business could be adversely affected by the \n","impacts of climate change.  The physical effects of climate \n","change, including the increased prevalence and severity of \n","extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as \n","hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere \n","with our operations or those of our third-party service providers, \n","which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause \n","losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively \n","affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the \n","credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the \n","deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, \n","changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on \n","account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a \n","low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain \n","industries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit \n","risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products \n","and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon \n","economy could affect our business practices or result in \n","additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business \n","operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with \n","climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and \n","expectations related to climate change and its impacts, could \n","require us to change certain of our business and/or risk \n","management practices, impose additional costs on us, reduce our \n","revenue or business opportunities, subject us to legal or \n","regulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","76 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","operations and business. Additionally, climate-related data may \n","be based on emerging practices that are subject to measurement \n","uncertainties or may be available only from third-parties, which \n","can impact the quality and consistency of the data and make it \n","difficult to collect, validate, and analyze, impact the effectiveness \n","of our related models, projections, strategies, and decisions, or \n","result in legal actions or other adverse consequences. Moreover, \n","our reputation may be damaged and we may lose business \n","opportunities as a result of our response to climate change or our \n","strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if \n","we are unable or perceived to be unable to achieve our objectives \n","or if our response is disliked or perceived to be ineffective or \n","insufficient. Similarly, any overstatement or mislabeling of the \n","environmental benefits of our products, services or activities may \n","subject us to legal actions, reputational harm, or other adverse \n","consequences. For additional information on regulatory \n","developments in response to climate change, see the \n","“Regulatory Matters” section in this Report. \n","We are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse \n","consequences from legal actions.  Wells Fargo and some of its \n","subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, \n","arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning \n","matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and \n","many of those proceedings and investigations expose \n","Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse \n","consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate \n","outcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for \n","legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions \n","become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We \n","may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not \n","established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a \n","legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts \n","accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal \n","action, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could \n","materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial \n","condition. \n","As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory \n","oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory \n","investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition \n","to imposing potentially significant fines, penalties, business \n","restrictions, and other adverse consequences, regulatory \n","authorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of \n","wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection \n","with settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, \n","loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital \n","markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to \n","engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or \n","services, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. \n","For additional information, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report. \n","MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS \n","Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to \n","quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, \n","and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to \n","reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new \n","mortgage loans.  We earn revenue from fees we receive for \n","originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. \n","Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair \n","value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage \n","loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from \n","loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our \n","MSRs usually tends to increase due to a decline in the likelihood \n","of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. \n","When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase \n","and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with \n","some offsetting revenue effect. Even though changes in interest \n","rates can cause this offsetting effect, the effect is not perfect, \n","either in amount or timing. \n","We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge \n","our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of \n","our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. \n","Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant \n","losses from our hedging activities. \n","We rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet \n","their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring \n","agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and \n","the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee \n","loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or \n","government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their \n","purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, \n","and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We \n","cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will \n","not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of \n","conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a \n","conforming loan. Similarly, there have been various proposals to \n","reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role \n","of the GSEs, which, depending on any ultimate reforms enacted, \n","could have an adverse impact on our mortgage banking business. \n","In addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that \n","do not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring \n","agencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance \n","sheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be \n","used to originate new loans. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate \n","and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of \n","Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical \n","Accounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” \n","sections in this Report. \n","We may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse \n","consequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect \n","to the residential mortgage loans or other assets we originate \n","or service.  For residential mortgage loans that we originate, we \n","could become subject to monetary damages and other civil \n","penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or \n","the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as \n","foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the \n","loans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or \n","regulations. \n","Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we \n","originate and sell, we may be required to repurchase the loans or \n","indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or \n","insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach \n","of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements \n","under which we sell the loans or in the insurance or guaranty \n","agreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. If economic \n","conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have \n","increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on \n","repurchases. We may also have repurchase or other obligations \n","to the extent we originate and securitize other assets, such as \n","credit card loans. \n","Furthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for \n","the mortgage loans we service, we may be terminated as servicer \n","or master servicer, required to indemnify the securitization \n","trustee against losses, and/or contractually obligated to \n","repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","77 \n","losses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing \n","income. \n","We may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers and/or \n","securitization investors, legal actions, or other adverse \n","consequences if we fail to meet our servicing obligations, \n","including our obligations with respect to mortgage foreclosure \n","actions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our \n","mortgage banking revenue may be negatively affected to the \n","extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure \n","or other servicing related costs. In addition, we may continue to \n","be subject to fines, penalties, business restrictions, reputational \n","harm, and other adverse consequences as a result of actual or \n","perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, \n","including with respect to our compliance with existing consent \n","order requirements, our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation \n","activities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our \n","servicing of flood zone properties. We may also face risks, \n","including regulatory, compliance, and market risks, as we pursue \n","our previously announced plans to reduce the amount of \n","residential mortgage loans we service. \n","For additional information, see the “Overview,” “Risk \n","Management – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking \n","Activities,” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of \n","Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” sections and \n","Note 13 (Legal Actions) and Note 17 (Guarantees and Other \n","Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","COMPETITIVE RISKS \n","We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly \n","evolving financial services industry. We compete with other \n","financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is \n","undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory \n","reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and \n","economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other \n","things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring \n","relationships with our customers based on the quality of our \n","customer service, the wide variety of products and services that \n","we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and \n","services to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the \n","pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution \n","channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our \n","reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all \n","of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, \n","market share and results of operations and/or cause us to \n","increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to \n","remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or \n","reprice our products and services from time to time may be \n","limited and could be influenced significantly by the economic, \n","regulatory and political environment for large financial \n","institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. \n","Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services \n","that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those \n","products and services could result in a loss of customer \n","relationships and market share and could materially adversely \n","affect our results of operations. \n","Continued technological advances and the growth of \n","e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository \n","institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were \n","banking products, and for financial institutions and other \n","companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial \n","solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and \n","payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including \n","digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may \n","diminish the importance of depository institutions and other \n","financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. \n","We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive \n","threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to \n","offer products and services at lower prices, increase our \n","investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing \n","products and services, and/or develop new products and services \n","to respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To the \n","extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new \n","products and services or responding or adapting to the \n","competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we \n","may lose customer relationships and our growth prospects and \n","results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n","Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical \n","to the success of our business and failure to do so could \n","adversely affect our business performance, competitive \n","position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is \n","heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, \n","including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, \n","including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, \n","capital markets, risk management, and technology, the \n","competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also \n","seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of \n","succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract \n","and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide \n","competitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, \n","effectively manage employee performance and development, \n","and foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large \n","financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain \n","subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on \n","compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our \n","ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially \n","if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same \n","compensation limitations. Similarly, union organizing activity, \n","some of which has been successful, could continue to increase \n","our operational complexity and costs. In addition, our response to \n","this activity could be perceived negatively and harm our \n","reputation and business, subject us to legal actions, or adversely \n","affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we \n","are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, \n","including successors for senior leadership positions, our business \n","performance, competitive position and future prospects may be \n","adversely affected. \n","FINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS \n","Changes in accounting standards, and changes in how \n","accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could \n","materially affect our financial results and condition.  From time \n","to time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting \n","and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our \n","external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard \n","setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such \n","as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their \n","previous interpretations or positions on how these standards \n","should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting \n","standards and changes in current interpretations are typically \n","beyond our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially \n","affect our financial results and condition, including requiring a \n","retrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. \n","Similarly, any change in our accounting policies could also \n","materially affect our financial statements.

Several of our \n","accounting policies are critical because they require management \n","to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about \n","matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that \n","materially different amounts would be reported under different \n","conditions or using different assumptions. If the assumptions, \n","judgments, or estimates underlying our financial results are \n","incorrect or different from actual results, we could experience \n","unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could \n","be significant. For a description of our critical accounting policies, \n","see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. \n","The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires \n","our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls \n","and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting \n","and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control \n","over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual \n","report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” \n","in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not \n","identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any \n","given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our \n","reputation or stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. \n","We could also be required to devote significant resources to \n","remediate any material weakness. In addition, our customers may \n","rely on the effectiveness of certain of our operational and \n","internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those \n","controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation \n","or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit \n","services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to \n","preserve their independence from us.

We provide banking, investment and mortgage \n","products and services, as well as consumer and commercial \n","finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and \n","other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and \n","institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in \n","countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the \n","Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company \n","and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the \n","Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \n","company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \n","investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock \n","outstanding. \n","Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \n","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \n","the financial services industry. To prepare the financial \n","statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make \n","estimates based on assumptions about future economic and \n","market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, \n","real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of \n","assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, \n","income and expenses during the reporting period and the related \n","disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current \n","conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is \n","reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than \n","anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our \n","results of operations and financial condition. Management has \n","made significant estimates in several areas, including: \n","• \n","allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related \n","Allowance for Credit Losses and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale \n","and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities)); \n","• \n","valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \n","(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 16 \n","(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \n","• \n","valuations of financial instruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of \n","Assets and Liabilities)); \n","• \n","liability for legal actions (Note 13 (Legal Actions)); \n","• \n","income taxes; and \n","• \n","goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other \n","Assets)). \n","Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n","Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023 \n","In 2023, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \n","• \n","Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial \n","Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt \n","Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures \n","• \n","ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair \n","Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method \n","• \n","ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \n","Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from \n","Contracts with Customers \n","• \n","ASU 2018-12, Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): \n","Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration \n","Contracts and subsequent related updates \n","ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and reporting for \n","troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces \n","new required disclosures for loan modifications made to \n","borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required \n","disclosures include information about modifications granted to \n","borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \n","forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \n","payment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these \n","modifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \n","financial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \n","in the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \n","amends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \n","of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \n","Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) for \n","additional information related to the new disclosures for loan \n","modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \n","for gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \n","on a prospective basis. \n","The Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \n","cash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \n","losses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \n","expected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \n","expected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications \n","and the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \n","defaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \n","expected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \n","2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \n","credit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \n","loans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \n","concession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \n","apply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, \n","resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \n","upon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\n","modification and post-modification effective interest rates that \n","would have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \n","as interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \n","our ACL of $429 million, pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \n","earnings of $323 million, after tax. We continue to use a DCF \n","approach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \n","commercial loans. \n","ASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method, which \n","expands an entity’s ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting \n","for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial \n","assets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \n","hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. \n","We adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023, on a \n","prospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the \n","opening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon \n","adoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \n","portfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \n","hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \n","financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \n","securities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger \n","proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \n","of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \n","increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \n","prepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \n","hedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \n","carrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \n","related to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at \n","a portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \n","portfolio. \n","Upon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \n","method hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update \n","88 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-\n","to-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities \n","are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 \n","days after the adoption date. \n","In January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities \n","with an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost \n","of $23.9 billion from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate \n","swaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges \n","using the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities \n","was recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately \n","$566 million of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt \n","securities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of \n","deferred taxes. \n","See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \n","Securities) for additional information about the Company’s \n","portfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \n","transfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 14 \n","(Derivatives) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \n","hedging relationships. \n","ASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) \n","805 – Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \n","measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \n","combination in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue Recognition. \n","Prior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \n","recognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \n","items at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \n","prospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a \n","material impact to our consolidated financial statements. \n","ASU 2018-12 changes the accounting for long-duration \n","insurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \n","the policyholder in addition to the policyholder’s account value. \n","These features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \n","protect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \n","risk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU \n","requires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \n","through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \n","own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \n","reinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \n","insurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are \n","accounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \n","reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. \n","We utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \n","risk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \n","because they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \n","The fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \n","in fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \n","behavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \n","mortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use \n","derivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \n","the interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \n","market risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \n","recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \n","recognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \n","excluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \n","noninterest income along with the changes in fair value of \n","economic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \n","credit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \n","adoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \n","implemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \n","retrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \n","in an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \n","earnings and increase accumulated other comprehensive income \n","by $738 million and $20 million, respectively, as of January 1, \n","2021. \n","The ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \n","assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \n","for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \n","amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting \n","changes for the liability of future policyholder benefits for \n","traditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses \n","and other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in \n","other assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption. \n","Table 1.1 presents the impact of adoption to prior period \n","financial statement line items within our consolidated statement \n","of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and \n","December 31, 2021, and the consolidated balance sheet as of \n","December 31, 2022.

Our variable \n","interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary \n","interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair \n","value of the entity’s net assets. We consolidate a VIE if we are the \n","primary beneficiary, which is when we have both the power to \n","direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a \n","variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \n","To determine whether or not a variable interest we hold could \n","potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider both qualitative \n","and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of \n","our involvement with the VIE. We assess whether or not we are \n","the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. \n"," Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are \n","eliminated in consolidation. When we have significant influence \n","over operating and financing decisions for a company but do not \n","own a majority of the voting equity interests, we account for the \n","investment using the equity method of accounting, which \n","requires us to recognize our proportionate share of the \n","company’s earnings. If we do not have significant influence, we \n","account for the equity security under the fair value method, cost \n","method or measurement alternative. \n","Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of net \n","income and equity attributable to third-party owners of \n","consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned by \n","Wells Fargo. Substantially all of our noncontrolling interests \n","relate to our affiliated venture capital businesses. \n","Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash \n","Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in cash \n","and due from banks and interest-earning deposits from banks on \n","our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are recorded at \n","amortized cost and include cash on hand, cash items in transit, \n","and amounts due from or held with other depository institutions. \n","See Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other \n","Restrictions) for additional information on the restrictions on \n","cash and cash equivalents. \n","Trading Activities \n","We engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment \n","and risk management activities of our customers. These \n","activities predominantly occur in our Corporate and Investment \n","Banking reportable operating segment. Trading assets and \n","liabilities include debt securities, equity securities, loans held for \n","sale, derivatives, and short sales, which are reported within our \n","consolidated balance sheet based on the accounting \n","classification of the instrument. In addition, certain instruments \n","that we have elected to account for under the fair value method, \n","such as debt securities that are held for investment purposes and \n","structured debt liabilities, are classified as trading. \n","Our trading assets and liabilities are carried on our \n","consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value \n","recognized in net gains from trading and securities within \n","noninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are \n","recognized in net interest income. \n","Customer accommodation trading activities include our \n","actions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments \n","and market-making activities. We also take positions to manage \n","our exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold \n","financial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short \n","positions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary, \n","we interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the \n","purchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the \n","anticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we \n","may purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to \n","manage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an \n","offsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure \n","to the customer transaction. We earn income based on the \n","transaction price difference between the customer transaction \n","and the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where \n","the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of \n","the positions are recorded. \n","Our market-making activities include taking long and short \n","trading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These \n","activities are typically executed on a short-term basis. As a \n","market-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference \n","between the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of \n","the security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the \n","positions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading \n","positions held on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we \n","may enter into separate derivative or security positions to \n","manage our exposure related to our long and short trading \n","positions taken in our market-making activities. Income earned \n","on these market-making activities are reflected in earnings \n","where the fair value changes and related interest income and \n","expense of the positions are recorded. \n","Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","90 \n","(continued) \n","Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities \n","Our investments in debt securities that are not held for trading \n","purposes are classified as either available-for-sale (AFS) or held-\n","to-maturity (HTM). \n","Investments in debt securities not held for trading purposes, \n","for which the Company does not have the positive intent and \n","ability to hold to maturity, are classified as AFS. AFS debt \n","securities are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and \n","losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income \n","(AOCI). The amount reported in other comprehensive income \n","(OCI) is net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and \n","applicable income taxes. Investments in debt securities for which \n","the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to \n","maturity are classified as HTM. HTM debt securities are \n","measured at amortized cost, net of ACL. See Note 3 (Available-\n","for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) for additional \n","information. \n","INTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION Unamortized \n","premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over \n","the contractual life of the security using the effective interest \n","method, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a \n","premium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a \n","premium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the \n","next call date using the effective interest method. As principal \n","repayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed \n","securities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related \n","premium or discount is recognized in income such that the \n","effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security \n","continues unchanged. \n","We recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt \n","securities in net gains from trading and securities within \n","noninterest income using the specific identification method. \n","IMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses on AFS debt \n","securities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in \n","interest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of \n","debt securities, and prepayment rates which impact MBS and \n","collateralized loan obligations (CLO). Additional considerations \n","for certain types of AFS debt securities include: \n","• \n","Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, \n","including federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit \n","movements given the explicit or implicit guarantees \n","provided by the U.S. government. \n","• \n","Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are \n","most impacted by changes in the relationship between \n","municipal and term funding credit curves rather than by \n","changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities. \n","• \n","Structured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also \n","impacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets \n","underlying the security. \n","For AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \n","amortized cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we \n","have the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not \n","that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its \n","amortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized in net gains on \n","trading and securities within noninterest income equal to the \n","difference between the amortized cost basis, net of ACL, and the \n","fair value of the AFS debt security. Following the recognition of \n","this impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost \n","basis is fair value. \n","For AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \n","amortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in \n","earnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the \n","extent unrealized loss is due to credit losses. See the “Allowance \n","for Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies \n","relating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt \n","securities classified as HTM. \n","TRANSFERS BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES  Transfers \n","of debt securities from the AFS to HTM classification are \n","recorded at fair value, and accordingly the amortized cost of the \n","security transferred to HTM is adjusted to fair value. Unrealized \n","gains or losses reported in AOCI at the transfer date are \n","amortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortized \n","premiums and discounts using the effective interest method. \n","Any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model \n","is reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re-\n","established. The reversal and re-establishment of the ACL are \n","recorded in provision for credit losses. \n","Transfers of debt securities from the HTM to AFS \n","classification are recorded at fair value. The HTM amortized cost \n","(excluding any ACL previously recorded under the HTM debt \n","security model) becomes the AFS amortized cost, and the debt \n","security is remeasured at fair value with the unrealized gains and \n","losses reported in OCI. Any ACL previously recorded under the \n","HTM debt security model is reversed and an ACL under the AFS \n","debt security model is re-established. The reversal and re-\n","establishment of the ACL are recorded in provision expense. \n","Transfers from HTM to AFS are only expected to occur under \n","limited circumstances. \n","NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES We \n","generally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors \n","similar to those described for loans. When we place a debt \n","security on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid \n","interest receivable against interest income and suspend the \n","amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. If the \n","ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual \n","debt security, any cash collected is first applied to reduce the \n","security’s amortized cost basis to zero, followed by recovery of \n","amounts previously charged off, and subsequently to interest \n","income. Generally, we return a debt security to accrual status \n","when all delinquent interest and principal become current under \n","the contractual terms of the security and collectability of \n","remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. \n","Our debt securities are considered past due when \n","contractually required principal or interest payments have not \n","been made on the due dates. \n","Our charge-off policy for debt securities is similar to our \n","charge-off policy for loans. Subsequent to charge-off, the debt \n","security will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process \n","described above for any cash received. \n","Securities and Other Collateralized Financing \n","Agreements \n","Resale and repurchase agreements, as well as securities \n","borrowing and lending agreements, are accounted for as \n","collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the \n","acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. We monitor the \n","fair value of securities or other assets purchased and sold as well \n","as the collateral pledged and received. Additional collateral is \n","pledged or returned to maintain the appropriate collateral \n","position for the transactions. These financing transactions do not \n","create material credit risk given the collateral provided and the \n","related monitoring process. \n","We include securities purchased under securities financing \n","agreements in federal funds sold and securities purchased under \n","resale agreements on our consolidated balance sheet. We include \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","91 \n","collateral other than securities purchased under resale \n","agreements in loans on our consolidated balance sheet. We \n","include securities sold under securities financing agreements in \n","short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. At \n","December 31, 2023 and 2022, short-term borrowings were \n","primarily federal funds purchased and securities sold under \n","agreements to repurchase. \n","Assets and liabilities arising from securities and other \n","collateralized financing transactions with a single counterparty \n","are presented net on the balance sheet provided they meet \n","certain criteria that permit balance sheet netting. See Note 18 \n","(Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities) for \n","additional information on our offsetting policy. \n","Loans Held for Sale \n","Loans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes originated or \n","purchased commercial and residential mortgage loans for sale in \n","the securitization or whole loan market. Residential mortgage \n","LHFS are accounted for at either fair value or the lower of cost or \n","fair value (LOCOM) and may be measured on an individual or pool \n","level basis. Commercial LHFS are generally measured at LOCOM, \n","except for certain commercial LHFS in our trading business that \n","are used in market-making activities where we have elected the \n","fair value option. Commercial LHFS are generally measured on an \n","individual basis. See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \n","Liabilities) for additional information regarding LHFS fair value \n","measurements.  \n","Gains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage \n","LHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest \n","income. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net \n","gains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are \n","recognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination \n","costs and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are \n","recognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at \n","LOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at \n","origination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale. \n","Interest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate \n","of the loan and is recorded in interest income. \n","Interest rate lock commitments to originate mortgage LHFS \n","are accounted for as derivatives and are measured at fair value. \n","When a determination is made at the time of commitment to \n","originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold \n","these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to \n","periodic review under our management evaluation processes, \n","including corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent \n","changes occur, including changes in interest rates, our business \n","strategy, or other market conditions, we may change our intent \n","to hold these loans. When management makes this \n","determination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS \n","portfolio at LOCOM. \n","Loans \n","Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of \n","any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized \n","deferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized \n","premiums or discounts on purchased loans. \n","Unearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts \n","and premiums are amortized to interest income generally over \n","the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest \n","method. Loan commitment fees collected at closing are deferred \n","and amortized to noninterest income on a straight-line basis \n","over the commitment period if loan funding is unlikely. Upon \n","funding, deferred loan commitment fees are amortized to \n","interest income over the contractual life of the loan. \n","Loans also include financing leases where we are the lessor \n","(see the “Leasing Activity” section in this Note for our accounting \n","policy for leases) and resale agreements involving collateral other \n","than securities (see “Securities and Other Collateralized \n","Financing Agreements” section in this Note for our accounting \n","policy for other collateralized financing agreements). \n","See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \n","for additional information regarding our accounting for loans. \n","NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS  We generally place loans on \n","nonaccrual status when: \n","• \n","the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes \n","uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the \n","borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, \n","if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; \n","• \n","they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential \n","mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the \n","loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; \n","• \n","part of the principal balance has been charged off; or \n","• \n","for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the \n","related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in \n","the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien \n","delinquency status. \n","Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are \n","generally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past \n","due. \n","When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the \n","accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and \n","suspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate \n","collectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a \n","nonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash \n","collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan \n","to zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise, \n","interest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received. \n","Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent \n","interest and principal become current under the terms of the \n","loan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and \n","interest is no longer doubtful. \n","We may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a \n","restructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of \n","sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial \n","strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios \n","and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated \n","performance under the previous terms and the underwriting \n","process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the \n","restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing \n","status. Loans will be placed on nonaccrual status and we may \n","record a charge-off if the re-underwriting did not include an \n","evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay or we believe it is \n","probable that principal and interest contractually due under the \n","modified terms of the agreement will not be collectible. Modified \n","loans that are placed on nonaccrual status will generally return to \n","accrual status when repayment of principal and interest is \n","reasonably assured and the borrower has demonstrated a \n","sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive \n","months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of payments made \n","prior to a modification, if applicable). \n","Our loans are considered past due when contractually \n","required principal or interest payments have not been made on \n","the due dates. \n","LOAN CHARGE-OFF POLICIES  For commercial loans, we generally \n","fully charge off or charge down to net realizable value (fair value \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","92 \n","(continued) \n","  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Note 1:\n","of collateral, less estimated costs to sell) for loans secured by \n","collateral when: \n","• \n","management judges the loan to be uncollectible; \n","• \n","repayment is deemed to be protracted beyond reasonable \n","time frames; \n","• \n","the loan has been classified as a loss by either our internal \n","loan review process or our banking regulatory agencies; \n","• \n","the customer has filed bankruptcy and the loss becomes \n","evident owing to a lack of assets; \n","• \n","the loan is 180 days past due unless both well-secured and in \n","the process of collection; or \n","• \n","the loan is probable of foreclosure, and we have received an \n","appraisal of less than the recorded loan balance. \n","For consumer loans, we fully charge off or charge down to \n","net realizable value when deemed uncollectible due to \n","bankruptcy or other factors, or no later than reaching a defined \n","number of days past due, as follows: \n","• \n","Residential mortgage loans – We generally charge down to \n","net realizable value when the loan is 180 days past due and \n","fully charge-off when the loan exceeds extended \n","delinquency dates. \n","• \n","Auto loans – We generally fully charge off when the loan is \n","120 days past due. \n","• \n","Credit card loans – We generally fully charge off when the \n","loan is 180 days past due. \n","• \n","Unsecured loans – We generally fully charge off when the \n","loan is 120 days past due. \n","• \n","Unsecured lines – We generally fully charge off when the \n","loan is 180 days past due. \n","• \n","Other secured loans – We generally fully or partially charge \n","down to net realizable value when the loan is 120 days past \n","due. \n","FORECLOSED ASSETS  Foreclosed assets obtained through our \n","lending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans \n","have been written down to their net realizable value prior to \n","foreclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is \n","recorded with a charge to the ACL at foreclosure. We allow up to \n","90 days after foreclosure to finalize determination of net \n","realizable value. Thereafter, changes in net realizable value are \n","recorded to noninterest expense. The net realizable value of \n","these assets is reviewed and updated periodically depending on \n","the type of property. Certain government-guaranteed mortgage \n","loans upon foreclosure are included in accounts receivable, not \n","foreclosed assets. These receivables were loans insured by the \n","Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the \n","Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are measured based on \n","the balance expected to be recovered from the FHA or VA. \n","Allowance for Credit Losses \n","The ACL is management’s estimate of the current expected life-\n","time credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit \n","commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and \n","unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for \n","sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for AFS and HTM debt \n","securities, other financing receivables measured at amortized \n","cost, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. While we \n","attribute portions of the allowance to specific financial asset \n","classes (loan and debt security portfolios), loan portfolio \n","segments (commercial and consumer) or major security type, the \n","entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \n","Our ACL process involves procedures to appropriately \n","consider the unique risk characteristics of our financial asset \n","classes, portfolio segments, and major security types. For each \n","loan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt security type, \n","losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans or securities \n","with similar risk characteristics. For loans and securities that do \n","not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, \n","the losses are estimated individually, which generally includes our \n","nonperforming large commercial loans and non-accruing HTM \n","debt securities. For AFS debt securities, losses are estimated at \n","the individual security level. \n","Our ACL amounts are influenced by a variety of factors, \n","including changes in loan and debt security volumes, portfolio \n","credit quality, and general economic conditions. General \n","economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables \n","which will create volatility as those variables change over time. \n","See Table 1.3 for key economic variables used for our loan \n","portfolios. \n","Table 1.3: Key Economic Variables \n","Loan Portfolio \n","Key economic variables \n","Total commercial \n","•      Gross domestic product \n","•      Commercial real estate asset prices, where applicable \n","•      Unemployment rate \n","Residential mortgage \n","•      Home price index \n","•      Unemployment rate \n","Other consumer (including credit card, auto, and other consumer) \n","•      Unemployment rate \n","Our approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses \n","for loans and debt securities includes the following key \n","components: \n","• \n","An initial loss forecast period of two years for all portfolio \n","segments and classes of financing receivables and off-\n","balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects \n","management’s expectation of losses based on forward-\n","looking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast \n","multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base \n","scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more \n","pessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by \n","management to estimate future credit losses. \n","• \n","Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting \n","to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the \n","economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast \n","period. These long-term averages are based on observations \n","over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which \n","may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \n","• \n","The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for \n","expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, \n","renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term \n","when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual \n","renewals or extension options. Credit card loans have \n","indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine \n","93 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","a contractual life by estimating the application of future \n","payments to the outstanding loan amount. \n","• \n","For AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests \n","classified as HTM, we utilize DCF methods to measure the \n","ACL, which incorporate expected credit losses using the \n","conceptual components described above. For most HTM \n","debt securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss \n","model, similar to the methodology used for loans. \n","The ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \n","valuation account that is deducted from, or added to, the \n","amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net \n","amount expected to be collected. When credit expectations \n","change, the valuation account is adjusted with changes reported \n","in provision for credit losses. If amounts previously charged off \n","are subsequently expected to be collected, we may recognize a \n","negative allowance, which is limited to the amount that was \n","previously charged off. For financial assets with an ACL \n","estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the \n","passage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS \n","debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to \n","expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is \n","less than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot \n","have an associated negative allowance. \n","For certain financial assets, such as residential real estate \n","loans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage \n","Association (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. \n","Treasury and Agency mortgage-backed debt securities and \n","certain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not \n","recognized an ACL as our expectation of loss is zero, based on \n","historical losses and consideration of current and forecasted \n","conditions. \n","For financial assets that are collateral-dependent, we use the \n","fair value of the collateral to measure the ACL. If we intend to sell \n","the underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the \n","collateral’s net realizable value. In most situations, based on our \n","charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial \n","asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For \n","consumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have \n","collateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other \n","personal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent \n","financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial \n","real estate or other business assets. \n","We do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest \n","receivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed \n","through interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-\n","accrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For \n","consumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we \n","include an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are \n","neither placed on nonaccrual status nor written off until the loan \n","is 180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in \n","other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit \n","card loans. \n","COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY \n","Generally, commercial loans, which include net investments in \n","lease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each \n","loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic \n","reviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio \n","reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with \n","the borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the \n","event of default, considering the quality of any underlying \n","collateral. Probability of default, loss severity at the time of \n","default, and exposure at default are statistically derived through \n","historical observations of default and losses after default within \n","each credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as \n","appropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted \n","economic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit \n","commitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to \n","derive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated \n","probability of default and loss severity at the time of default are \n","applied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses \n","for unfunded credit commitments. \n","CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  For \n","consumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled \n","approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans \n","within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that \n","estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of \n","default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to \n","estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, \n","generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such \n","as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. \n","As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further \n","stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, \n","geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use \n","attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation \n","(FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the \n","development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home \n","price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic \n","variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses \n","in the consumer portfolio. \n","OTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for \n","qualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our \n","loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment \n","of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the \n","ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level \n","below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic \n","environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, \n","process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry \n","trends and emerging risk assessments. \n","OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES  Our off-balance sheet \n","credit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally \n","in the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not \n","accounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including \n","standby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-\n","balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated \n","with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for \n","commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our \n","discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial \n","guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as \n","loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for \n","off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in \n","accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated \n","balance sheet. \n","OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated \n","for expected credit losses. These other financial assets include \n","accounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-\n","sponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage \n","Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage \n","Corporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts \n","receivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as \n","central clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are \n","generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss \n","expectation (e.g., government guarantee) based on no historical \n","credit losses and consideration of current and forecasted \n","conditions. Some financial assets, such as loans to employees, \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","94 \n","(continued) \n","  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Note 1:\n","maintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with the related \n","amortized cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated \n","balance sheet. A provision for credit losses is not recognized \n","separately from the regular income or expense associated with \n","these financial assets. \n","Securities purchased under resale agreements are generally \n","over-collateralized by securities or cash and are generally short-\n","term in nature. We have elected the practical expedient for these \n","financial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These \n","provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and \n","customers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. \n","Accordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these \n","financial assets. \n","See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \n","for additional information. \n","Purchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \n","Financial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with \n","more than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since \n","their origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated \n","(PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities \n","and loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an \n","ACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, \n","there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; \n","rather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial \n","asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a \n","corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected \n","credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for \n","credit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income \n","recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest \n","income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset. \n","Leasing Activity \n","AS LESSOR  We lease equipment to our customers under \n","financing or operating leases. Financing leases, which includes \n","both direct financing and sales-type leases, are presented in \n","loans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease \n","payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the \n","leased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing \n","leases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-\n","party investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual \n","lease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that \n","we believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The \n","residual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales \n","price for the equipment at lease termination based on sales \n","history adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets. \n","Many of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at \n","prevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at \n","lease termination. \n","Our allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers \n","both the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as \n","the estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically \n","purchase residual value insurance on our financing leases to \n","reduce the risk of loss at lease termination. \n","In connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s \n","purchase of other products or services from the equipment \n","vendor and allocate the contract consideration between the use \n","of the asset and the purchase of those products or services. \n","Amounts allocated are reported in loans as commercial and \n","industrial loans, rather than as lease financing. \n","Our primary income from financing leases is interest income \n","recognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease \n","revenue, such as reimbursement for property taxes, are included \n","in lease income within noninterest income. \n","Operating lease assets are presented in other assets, net of \n","accumulated depreciation. Periodic depreciation expense is \n","recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of \n","the leased asset and are included in other noninterest expense. \n","Operating lease assets are reviewed periodically for impairment \n","and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of \n","operating lease assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. \n","Recoverability is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of \n","the leased assets to undiscounted cash flows expected through \n","the operation or sale of the asset. Impairment charges for \n","operating lease assets are included in other noninterest income. \n","Operating lease rental income for leased assets is recognized \n","in lease income within noninterest income on a straight-line basis \n","over the lease term. Variable revenue on operating leases include \n","reimbursements of costs, including property taxes, which \n","fluctuate over time, as well as rental revenue based on usage. For \n","leases of railcars, revenue for maintenance services provided \n","under the lease is recognized in lease income. \n","We elected to exclude from revenue and expenses any sales \n","tax incurred on lease payments which are reimbursed by the \n","lessee. Substantially all of our leased assets are protected against \n","casualty loss through third-party insurance. \n","AS LESSEE We enter into lease agreements to obtain the right to \n","use assets for our business operations, substantially all of which \n","are real estate. Lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets are \n","recognized when we enter into operating or financing leases and \n","represent our obligations and rights to use these assets over the \n","period of the leases and may be re-measured for certain \n","modifications. \n","Operating lease liabilities include fixed and in-substance \n","fixed payments for the contractual duration of the lease, \n","adjusted for renewals or terminations which were considered \n","probable of exercise when measured. The lease payments are \n","discounted using a rate that approximates a collateralized \n","borrowing rate for the estimated duration of the lease as the \n","implicit discount rate is typically not known. The discount rate is \n","updated when re-measurement events occur. The related \n","operating lease ROU assets may differ from operating lease \n","liabilities due to initial direct costs, deferred or prepaid lease \n","payments and lease incentives. \n","We present operating lease liabilities in accrued expenses \n","and other liabilities and the related operating lease ROU assets in \n","other assets. The amortization of operating lease ROU assets \n","and the accretion of operating lease liabilities are reported \n","together as fixed lease expense and are included in occupancy \n","expense within noninterest expense. The fixed lease expense is \n","recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. \n","Some operating leases include variable lease payments and \n","are recognized as incurred in net occupancy expense within \n","noninterest expense. \n","For substantially all of our leased assets, we account for \n","consideration paid under the contract for maintenance or other \n","services as lease payments. We exclude certain asset classes, with \n","original terms of less than one year from the operating lease \n","ROU assets and lease liabilities. The related short-term lease \n","expense is included in net occupancy expense. \n","Finance lease liabilities are presented in long-term debt and \n","the associated finance ROU assets are presented in premises and \n","equipment. \n","See Note 8 (Leasing Activity) for additional information. \n","95 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Deposits, Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt \n","Customer deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt \n","are recorded at amortized cost, unless we have elected the fair \n","value option for these items. For example, we may elect the fair \n","value option for certain structured notes. We generally report \n","borrowings with original maturities of one year or less as short-\n","term borrowings and borrowings with original maturities of \n","greater than one year as long-term debt on our consolidated \n","balance sheet. We do not reclassify long-term debt to short-\n","term borrowings within a year of maturity. \n","Refer to Note 9 (Deposits) for further information on \n","deposits, Note 10 (Long-Term Debt) for further information on \n","long-term debt, and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \n","Liabilities) for additional information on fair value, including fair \n","value option elections. \n","Securitizations and Beneficial Interests \n","Securitizations are transactions in which financial assets are sold \n","to a Special Purpose Entity (SPE), which then issues beneficial \n","interests collateralized by the transferred financial assets. \n","Beneficial interests are generally issued in the form of senior and \n","subordinated interests, and in some cases, we may obtain \n","beneficial interests issued by the SPE. Additionally, from time to \n","time, we may re-securitize certain financial assets in a new \n","securitization transaction. See Note 16 (Securitizations and \n","Variable Interest Entities) for additional information about our \n","involvement with SPEs. \n","The assets and liabilities transferred to a SPE are excluded \n","from our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies \n","as a sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. \n","For transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we \n","recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained \n","(including beneficial interests or mortgage servicing rights) and \n","all liabilities incurred. We record a gain or loss in noninterest \n","income for the difference between assets obtained (net of \n","liabilities incurred) and the carrying amount of the assets sold. \n","Beneficial interests obtained from, and liabilities incurred in, \n","securitizations with off-balance sheet entities may include debt \n","and equity securities, loans, MSRs, derivative assets and \n","liabilities, other assets, and other obligations such as liabilities \n","for mortgage repurchase losses or long-term debt and are \n","accounted for as described within this Note. \n","Mortgage Servicing Rights \n","We recognize MSRs resulting from a sale or securitization of \n","mortgage loans that we originate or through a direct purchase of \n","such rights. We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. \n","Subsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. \n","Commercial MSRs are subsequently measured at LOCOM. The \n","valuation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in Note 6 \n","(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets \n","and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \n","Entities). \n","For MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are \n","reported in mortgage banking noninterest income in the period \n","in which the change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at \n","LOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, \n","estimated net servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is \n","reported in mortgage banking noninterest income, analyzed \n","monthly and adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment rates, as \n","well as other factors. \n","MSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated \n","for impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For \n","purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we \n","stratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of \n","the underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by \n","individual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds \n","fair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation \n","allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. \n","Premises and Equipment \n","Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated \n","depreciation and amortization. We use the straight-line method \n","of depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization \n","expense for premises and equipment was $1.3 billion in 2023, \n","$1.2 billion in 2022, and $1.4 billion in 2021. Estimated useful \n","lives range up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, up to \n","10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the \n","estimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease term for \n","leasehold improvements. \n","Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets \n","Goodwill is recorded for business combinations when the \n","purchase price is higher than the fair value of the acquired net \n","assets, including identifiable intangible assets. \n","We assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level \n","on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. \n","We have determined that our reporting units are at the \n","reportable operating segment level or one level below. We \n","identify the reporting units based on how the segments and \n","reporting units are managed, taking into consideration the \n","economic characteristics, nature of the products and services, \n","and customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate \n","goodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair \n","value at the time we acquire a business and when we have a \n","significant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion \n","of goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested \n","business. \n","We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment \n","of goodwill. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative test and \n","proceed directly to a quantitative test. If we perform a qualitative \n","assessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is \n","more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater \n","than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. \n","However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a \n","reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we \n","complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is \n","goodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation \n","methodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings \n","multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, \n","which is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. \n","A goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less \n","than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill \n","impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to \n","the reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge \n","to other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying \n","value of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment \n","are prohibited. \n","We amortize customer relationship intangible assets on an \n","accelerated basis over useful lives not exceeding 10 years. We \n","review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or \n","changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts \n","may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of \n","undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the \n","carrying value of the asset.

On the date we enter into a derivative \n","contract, we categorize the derivative as either an accounting \n","hedge, economic hedge, or part of our customer accommodation \n","trading portfolio. \n","Accounting hedges are either fair value or cash flow hedges. \n","Fair value hedges represent the hedge of the fair value of a \n","recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm \n","commitment, including hedges of foreign currency exposure. \n","Cash flow hedges represent the hedge of a forecasted \n","transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received \n","related to a recognized asset or liability. \n","Economic hedges and customer accommodation trading \n","derivatives do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply, \n","hedge accounting. Economic hedges are derivatives we \n","use to manage interest rate, foreign currency and certain other \n","risks associated with our non-trading activities. Our customer \n","accommodation trading portfolio represents derivatives related \n","to our trading business activities. We report changes in the fair \n","values of these derivatives in noninterest income or noninterest \n","expense. \n","FAIR VALUE HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \n","derivative in income, except for certain derivatives in which a \n","portion is recorded to OCI. We record basis adjustments to the \n","amortized cost of the hedged asset or liability due to the changes \n","in fair value related to the hedged risk, except for basis \n","adjustments related to active portfolio layer method hedges \n","which are maintained at a portfolio level and not allocated to the \n","individual assets in the portfolio. The offset to fair value hedge \n","basis adjustments is recorded in earnings. We present derivative \n","gains or losses in the same income statement category as the \n","hedged asset or liability, as follows: \n","• \n","For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, amounts are \n","reflected in net interest income; \n","• \n","For hedges of foreign currency risk, amounts representing \n","the fair value changes less the accrual for periodic cash flow \n","settlements are reflected in noninterest income. The \n","periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest \n","income; \n","• \n","For hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency \n","risk, amounts representing the fair value change less the \n","accrual for periodic cash flow settlements is attributed to \n","both net interest income and noninterest income. The \n","periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest \n","income. \n","The entire derivative gain or loss is included in the \n","assessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge \n","relationships, except for hedges of foreign-currency \n","denominated AFS debt securities and long-term debt liabilities \n","hedged with cross-currency swaps. The change in fair value of \n","these swaps attributable to cross-currency basis spread changes \n","is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The \n","initial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to net \n","interest income and the difference between changes in fair value \n","of the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings \n","is recorded in OCI. \n","CASH FLOW HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \n","derivative in OCI. We subsequently reclassify gains and losses \n","from these changes in fair value from OCI to earnings in the same \n","period(s) that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the \n","same income statement category as the hedged item. The entire \n","gain or loss on these derivatives is included in the assessment of \n","hedge effectiveness. \n","DOCUMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT FOR \n","ACCOUNTING HEDGES For fair value and cash flow hedges \n","qualifying for hedge accounting, we formally document at \n","inception the relationship between hedging instruments and \n","hedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our \n","evaluation of effectiveness for our hedge transactions. This \n","process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or \n","cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on our \n","consolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. \n","We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at \n","inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. \n","For fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing \n","the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument \n","against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability \n","being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow \n","hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic \n","changes in fair value of the hedging instrument against the \n","periodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The \n","hypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and \n","offset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged \n","due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for \n","fair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the \n","quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate \n","the conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we \n","also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in \n","each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly \n","effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the \n","hedged item using the regression analysis method. \n","For portfolio layer method fair value hedges, an assessment \n","test is also performed at inception of the hedging relationship \n","and on an ongoing basis to support our expectation that the \n","hedged item is anticipated to be outstanding for the designated \n","hedge period. \n","DISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING  We discontinue hedge \n","accounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly \n","effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a \n","hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or \n","exercised, (3) we elect to discontinue hedge accounting, (4) the \n","forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in a \n","cash flow hedge, or (5) the hedged item is no longer anticipated \n","to be outstanding for the designated hedge period in a portfolio \n","layer method hedge. \n","When we discontinue fair value hedge accounting for \n","portfolio layer method hedges, the associated portfolio level \n","basis adjustment is allocated to the remaining securities in the \n","portfolio on a proportionate basis. Upon discontinuance of all \n","other fair value hedges, we no longer adjust the previously \n","hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. \n","The remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item \n","and accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in \n","the same manner as other components of the carrying amount \n","of the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt \n","instruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, \n","these amounts are amortized into net interest income over the \n","remaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized \n","cost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the \n","accumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately \n","reclassified to net interest income. If the derivative continues to \n","be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we carry the \n","derivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with \n","changes in fair value included in noninterest income. \n","97 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","When we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is \n","probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the \n","accumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date \n","continues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction \n","affects earnings at which point the related OCI amount is \n","reclassified to net interest income. If cash flow hedge accounting \n","is discontinued and it is no longer probable the forecasted \n","transaction will occur, the accumulated gains and losses reported \n","in OCI at the de-designation date is immediately reclassified to \n","noninterest income. If the derivative continues to be held after \n","cash flow hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on our \n","consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair \n","value included in noninterest income. \n","EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  We may purchase or originate financial \n","instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception \n","of the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic \n","characteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and \n","closely related to the economic characteristics of the host \n","contract, (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the \n","embedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at \n","fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if \n","a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded \n","instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the \n","embedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate \n","it from the hybrid contract by recording the bifurcated derivative \n","at fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference \n","between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of \n","the bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at \n","fair value and accounted for in accordance with its categorization \n","as an accounting hedge, economic hedge, or customer \n","accommodation trading derivative. The accounting for the \n","remaining host contract is the same as other assets and liabilities \n","of a similar type and reported on our consolidated balance sheet \n","based upon the accounting classification of the instrument. \n","COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING  By using derivatives, \n","we are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that \n","counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as \n","expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty \n","credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset \n","on our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a \n","derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to \n","the extent subject to legally enforceable master netting \n","arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same \n","counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize \n","counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, \n","monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements \n","and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit \n","risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value \n","and our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent \n","derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the \n","applicable requirements, including determining the legal \n","enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present \n","derivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on \n","our consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to \n","reflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments \n","(CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, \n","which considers the effects of enforceable master netting \n","agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based \n","views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate \n","CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap \n","market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the \n","counterparties to our derivatives. \n","Cash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate \n","derivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with \n","centrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the \n","derivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to \n","separate non-derivative receivables or payables. This cash \n","collateral, also referred to as variation margin, is exchanged \n","based upon derivative fair value changes, typically on a one-day \n","lag. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging \n","activities, see Note 14 (Derivatives). \n","Equity Securities \n","Equity securities exclude investments that represent a \n","controlling interest in the investee. Marketable equity securities \n","have readily determinable fair values and are predominantly used \n","in our trading activities. Marketable equity securities are \n","recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and \n","losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in \n","noninterest income. Dividend income from marketable equity \n","securities is recognized in interest income. \n","Nonmarketable equity securities do not have readily \n","determinable fair values. These securities are accounted for \n","under one of the following accounting methods: \n","• \n","Fair value through net income: This method is an election. \n","The securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains \n","or losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities \n","in noninterest income; \n","• \n","Equity method: This method is applied when we have the \n","ability to exert significant influence over the investee. The \n","securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of \n","the investee’s earnings or losses, less any dividends received \n","and/or impairment. Equity method adjustments for our \n","share of the investee’s earnings or losses are recognized in \n","other noninterest income and dividends are recognized as a \n","reduction of the investment carrying value; \n","• \n","Proportional amortization method: This method is applied to \n","certain low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. \n","The investments are initially recorded at cost and amortized \n","in proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of \n","the investments and the related tax impacts are recognized \n","in income tax expense; \n","• \n","Cost method: This method is required for specific securities, \n","such as Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan \n","Bank stock. These securities are held at cost less any \n","impairment; \n","• \n","Measurement alternative: This method is followed by all \n","remaining nonmarketable equity securities. These securities \n","are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value \n","as of the date of an orderly observable transaction of the \n","same or similar security of the same issuer. These securities \n","are also adjusted for impairment. \n","All realized and unrealized gains and losses, including \n","impairment losses, from nonmarketable equity securities are \n","recognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest \n","income. Dividend income from all nonmarketable equity \n","securities, other than equity method securities, is recognized in \n","interest income. \n","Our review for impairment for nonmarketable equity \n","securities not carried at fair value includes an analysis of the facts \n","and circumstances of each security, the intent or requirement to \n","sell the security, the expectations of cash flows, capital needs and \n","the viability of its business model. When the fair value of an \n","equity method or cost method investment is less than its \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","98 \n","(continued) \n","  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Note 1:\n","carrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value when we \n","consider declines in value to be other than temporary. When \n","the fair value of an investment accounted for using the \n","measurement alternative is less than its carrying value, we write-\n","down the asset to fair value, without the consideration of \n","anticipated recovery. \n","See Note 4 (Equity Securities) for additional information. \n","Pension Accounting \n","We sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit \n","retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan \n","(Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of \n","Wells Fargo. We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans \n","that provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to \n","certain eligible employees. We account for our defined benefit \n","pension plans using an actuarial model. Principal assumptions \n","used in determining the net periodic pension cost and the \n","pension obligation include the discount rate, the expected long-\n","term rate of return on plan assets and projected mortality rates. \n","A single weighted-average discount rate is used to estimate \n","the present value of our future pension benefit obligations. We \n","determine the discount rate using a yield curve derived from a \n","broad-based population of high-quality corporate bonds with \n","maturity dates that closely match the estimated timing of the \n","expected benefit payments. \n","We use the full year curve approach to estimate the interest \n","cost component of pension expense for our principal defined \n","benefit and postretirement plans. The full yield curve approach \n","aligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected \n","benefit payment cash flows. \n","The determination of our expected long-term rate of return \n","on plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the \n","current asset allocations and expected returns using forward-\n","looking capital market assumptions. We use the resulting \n","projections to derive a baseline expected rate of return for the \n","Cash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix. \n","Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables \n","published by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our \n","specific experience. \n","At year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan \n","liabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting \n","actuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial \n","gain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from AOCI into net periodic \n","pension cost over the estimated average remaining participation \n","period, which at December 31, 2023, is 17 years. See Note 22 \n","(Employee Benefits) for additional information on our pension \n","accounting. \n","Income Taxes \n","We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we \n","operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: \n","current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax \n","expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded \n","for the current period and includes income tax expense related to \n","uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the \n","more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to \n","determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax \n","position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that \n","management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of \n","realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our \n","realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \n","Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \n","method and deferred income tax expense results from changes \n","in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the \n","balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is \n","based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and \n","tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates \n","and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. \n","Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s \n","judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation \n","allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. \n","See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes \n","and related income tax assets and liabilities. \n","Stock-Based Compensation \n","Our long-term incentive plans provide awards for employee \n","services in various forms, such as restricted share rights (RSRs) \n","and performance share awards (PSAs). \n","Stock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant \n","date. The cost is recognized in personnel expense, net of actual \n","forfeitures, in our consolidated statement of income normally \n","over the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting \n","are expensed on a straight-line method. Awards to employees \n","who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to \n","immediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who \n","become retirement eligible before the final vesting date are \n","expensed between the grant date and the date the employee \n","becomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other \n","limited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment \n","ends. \n","For PSAs, compensation expense fluctuates based on the \n","estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions. The \n","total expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized \n","upon the completion of the performance period. \n","For additional information on our stock-based employee \n","compensation plans, see Note 12 (Common Stock and Stock \n","Plans). \n","Earnings Per Common Share \n","We compute earnings per common share by dividing net income \n","applicable to common stock (net income less dividends on \n","preferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over \n","carrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the \n","average number of common shares outstanding during the \n","period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using \n","net income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of \n","common stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are \n","dilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding \n","during the period. \n","Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities \n","Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an \n","asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \n","between market participants at the measurement date. Fair \n","value is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of \n","observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \n","We measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we \n","are required to record them at fair value, when we have elected \n","the fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure \n","requirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a \n","recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are \n","recorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value \n","measurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that \n","are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to \n","fair value only as required through the application of an \n","accounting method such as LOCOM, write-downs of individual \n","assets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain \n","nonmarketable equity securities. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","99 \n","We classify our assets and liabilities measured at fair value \n","based upon a three-level hierarchy that assigns the highest \n","priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \n","lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels are as \n","follows: \n","• \n","Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical \n","instruments traded in active markets. \n","• \n","Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar \n","instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or \n","similar instruments in markets that are not active, and \n","model-based valuation techniques for which all significant \n","assumptions are observable in the market. \n","• \n","Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use \n","significant assumptions that are not observable in the \n","market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our \n","estimates of assumptions that market participants would \n","use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques \n","include use of discounted cash flow models, market \n","comparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar \n","techniques. \n","We monitor the availability of observable market data to \n","assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments \n","within the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1, \n","Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes \n","but is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions. \n","Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will \n","drive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes \n","in availability of observable market data, which also may result in \n","changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of \n","transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The amounts \n","reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning \n","of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. \n","See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for a more \n","detailed discussion of the valuation methodologies that we apply \n","to our assets and liabilities. \n","Supplemental Cash Flow Information \n","Significant noncash activities are presented in Table 1.4. \n","Table 1.4: Supplemental Cash Flow Information \n","Year ended December 31, \n","(in millions) \n","2023 \n","2022 \n","2021 \n","Held-to-maturity debt securities purchased from securitization of loans held for sale \n","$ \n","94 \n","745 \n","20,265 \n","Transfers from loans to loans held for sale \n","1,920 \n","6,586 \n","19,297 \n","Transfers from available-for-sale debt securities to held-to-maturity debt securities \n","3,687 \n","50,132 \n","55,993 \n","Transfers from held-to-maturity debt securities to available-for-sale debt securities (1) \n","23,919 \n","— \n","— \n","(1) \n","In first quarter 2023, we reclassified HTM debt securities to AFS debt securities in connection with the adoption of ASU 2022-01. \n","Subsequent Events \n","We have evaluated the effects of events that have occurred \n","subsequent to December 31, 2023, and there have been no \n","material events that would require recognition in our 2023 \n","consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to \n","the consolidated financial statements. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","100 \n","(continued) \n","  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Note 1:\n","Note 2: Trading Activities \n","Table 2.1 presents a summary of our trading assets and liabilities \n","measured at fair value through earnings. \n","Table 2.1: Trading Assets and Liabilities \n","(in millions) \n","Dec 31, \n","2023 \n","Dec 31, \n","2022 \n","Trading assets: \n","Debt securities \n","$ \n","97,302 \n","86,155 \n","Equity securities \n","18,449 \n","26,910 \n","Loans held for sale \n","1,793 \n","1,466 \n","Gross trading derivative assets \n","71,990 \n","77,148 \n","Netting (1) \n","(54,069) \n","(54,922) \n","Total trading derivative assets \n","17,921 \n","22,226 \n","Total trading assets \n","135,465 \n","136,757 \n","Trading liabilities: \n","Short sale and other liabilities \n","25,471 \n","20,304 \n","Interest-bearing deposits \n","1,297 \n","— \n","Long-term debt \n","2,308 \n","1,346 \n","Gross trading derivative liabilities \n","77,807 \n","77,698 \n","Netting (1) \n","(60,366) \n","(59,232) \n","Total trading derivative liabilities \n","17,441 \n","18,466 \n","Total trading liabilities \n","$ \n","46,517 \n","40,116 \n","(1) \n","Represents balance sheet netting for trading derivative asset and liability balances, and trading portfolio level counterparty valuation adjustments. \n","Table 2.2 provides net interest income earned from trading \n","securities, and net gains and losses due to the realized and \n","unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. \n","Net interest income also includes dividend income on \n","trading securities and dividend expense on trading securities we \n","have sold, but not yet purchased. \n","Table 2.2: Net Interest Income and Net Gains (Losses) from Trading Activities \n","Year ended December 31, \n","(in millions) \n","2023 \n","2022 \n","2021 \n","Net interest income: \n","Interest income (1) \n","$ \n","4,229 \n","3,011 \n","2,567 \n","Interest expense \n","643 \n","592 \n","405 \n","Total net interest income \n","3,586 \n","2,419 \n","2,162 \n","Net gains (losses) from trading activities, by risk type: \n","Interest rate \n","444 \n","456 \n","(587) \n","Commodity \n","372 \n","345 \n","10 \n","Equity \n","1,106 \n","883 \n","52 \n","Foreign exchange \n","2,124 \n","1,168 \n","839 \n","Credit \n","753 \n","(736) \n","(30) \n","Total net gains from trading activities \n","4,799 \n","2,116 \n","284 \n","Total trading-related net interest and noninterest income \n","$ \n","8,385 \n","4,535 \n","2,446 \n","(1) \n","Substantially all relates to interest income on debt and equity securities. \n","101 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Note 3:  Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities \n","Table 3.1 provides the amortized cost, net of the allowance for \n","credit losses (ACL) for debt securities, and fair value by major \n","categories of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, which are \n","carried at fair value, and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, \n","which are carried at amortized cost, net of the ACL.

Loan \n","delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-\n","to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary \n","credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our \n","evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer \n","loan portfolio segment. \n","Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for \n","loans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency \n","is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of \n","our ACL for consumer loans. \n","We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are \n","generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited \n","circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit \n","Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain \n","loan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due \n","to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. \n","LTV is the ratio of the outstanding loan balance divided by \n","the property collateral value. For junior lien mortgages, we use \n","the total combined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages \n","(including unused line of credit amounts). We obtain LTVs using a \n","cascade approach which first uses values provided by automated \n","valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not \n","available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised \n","value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the \n","property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised \n","value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method \n","considered for high value properties, generally with an original \n","value of $1.5 million or more as of December 31, 2023, and \n","$1.0 million or more as of December 31, 2022, as the AVM values \n","have proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we \n","update LTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an \n","LTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios \n","acquired from or serviced by other institutions. \n","Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following \n","table for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we monitor \n","as part of our credit risk management practices; however, \n","charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan \n","portfolio. \n","Credit quality information is provided with the year of \n","origination for term loans.

Commercial \n","loan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \n","borrower’s request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \n","individual basis. \n","Our consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \n","product and the modification program offered to the borrower, \n","and may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term \n","extensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \n","combination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \n","loan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \n","payment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \n","a result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \n","interest. \n","Our residential mortgage loan modification programs may \n","offer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower’s \n","demonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \n","is needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \n","loan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \n","period of three months to determine if the borrower can perform \n","in accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \n","terms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \n","through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \n","original terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \n","our loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \n","successfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \n","is formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \n","payment period totaled $109 million at December 31, 2023. \n","Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \n","credit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or \n","long-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \n","reduces the borrower’s interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \n","interest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \n","interest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \n","period, the borrower’s revolving charge privileges are revoked. \n","Auto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \n","three months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. \n","The following disclosures provide information on loan \n","modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \n","difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \n","reductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \n","months) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \n","these modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \n","modifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \n","following the modification.

In addition, Wells Fargo and our \n","subsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or \n","otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct \n","of investigations of other persons or industry groups. \n","We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses \n","associated with the actions become probable and the costs can \n","be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the \n","amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of \n","potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if \n","we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low \n","end of the range of those potential losses. There can be no \n","assurance as to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including \n","the matters described below, and the actual costs of resolving \n","legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the \n","amounts accrued for those actions. \n","ADVISORY ACCOUNT CASH SWEEP INVESTIGATION The United \n","States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has \n","undertaken an investigation regarding the cash sweep options \n","that the Company provides to investment advisory clients at \n","account opening. \n","COMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS Federal government agencies, \n","including the United States Department of Labor (Department \n","of Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions \n","associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of \n","the Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the \n","401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with \n","the Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously \n","disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve \n","the Department of Labor’s review. On September 26, 2022, \n","participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class \n","action in the United States District Court for the District of \n","Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee \n","Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with \n","certain of these transactions. \n","HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS  Government agencies, including the \n","United States Department of Justice and the SEC, have \n","undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations \n","regarding the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. The \n","United States Department of Justice and the SEC have since \n","closed their investigations without taking action.

Allegations related to the \n","Company’s hiring practices related to diversity are also among \n","the subjects of shareholder derivative lawsuits pending in the \n","United States District Court for the Northern District of \n","California and in the Delaware Court of Chancery. \n","INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of \n","merchants have filed putative class actions, and individual \n","merchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, \n","N.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and \n","Wachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated \n","with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, \n","MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding \n","companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These \n","actions have been consolidated in the United States District \n","Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and \n","consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based \n","on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks \n","damages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege \n","that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully \n","colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that \n","enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged \n","tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are \n","anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other \n","defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment \n","Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other \n","entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the \n","Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and \n","the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed \n","a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to \n","resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate \n","settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The \n","settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the \n","consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately \n","$6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants \n","opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided \n","for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of \n","default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period \n","of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final \n","approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United \n","States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement \n","objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the \n","settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On \n","June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement \n","agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action \n","to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n","New York for further proceedings. On November 30, 2016, the \n","district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class \n","and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a \n","settlement agreement to resolve the damages class claims \n","pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately \n","$6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3 billion of funds \n","remaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in \n","additional funding. The Company’s allocated responsibility for \n","the additional funding is approximately $94.5 million. The court \n","granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, \n","which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n","Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. On March 15, \n","2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the damages class settlement. \n","On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ \n","motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several \n","of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled \n","while others remain pending. \n","136 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION  In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \n","Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a \n","complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern \n","District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, \n","N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential \n","mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising \n","similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the \n","Southern District of New York, IKB International and IKB \n","Deutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, \n","and Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state \n","court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, \n","N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert \n","causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s \n","alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of \n","mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations \n","and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and \n","abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events \n","of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix \n","Light’s claims and certain of the claims asserted by \n","Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each \n","case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix \n","Light and Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court’s \n","decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \n","Circuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, \n","terminating its case. In November 2023, the Company entered \n","into an agreement with IKB to resolve IKB’s claims. The Company \n","previously settled two class actions filed by institutional \n","investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union \n","Administration with similar allegations. \n","SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of \n","Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \n","Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \n","the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the \n","assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \n","to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as \n","plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. \n","OUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals \n","for legal actions when potential losses associated with the \n","actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \n","estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \n","losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and \n","estimable losses was approximately $1.7 billion as of \n","December 31, 2023. The outcomes of legal actions are \n","unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is \n","inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or \n","even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the \n","amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is \n","probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. \n","Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established \n","accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on \n","information currently available, advice of counsel, available \n","insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo \n","believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells \n","Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the \n","aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s \n","consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the \n","ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material \n","to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","137\n","Note 14: Derivatives \n","We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \n","interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to \n","assist customers with their risk management objectives. We \n","designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in \n","qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow \n","hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges \n","that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for \n","customer accommodation trading purposes. \n","Risk Management Derivatives \n","Our asset/liability management approach to interest rate, \n","foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of \n","derivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash \n","flow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help \n","minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair \n","values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest \n","rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This \n","approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of \n","certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, \n","foreign currency and other exposures, which may cause the \n","hedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have \n","a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows \n","and earnings. \n","Customer Accommodation Trading \n","We also use various derivatives, including interest rate, \n","commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, \n","as an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading \n","businesses. These derivative transactions, which involve \n","engaging in market-making activities or acting as an \n","intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers \n","manage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from \n","such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such \n","as separate derivative or security transactions. \n","Table 14.1 presents the total notional or contractual amounts \n","and fair values for our derivatives. Derivative transactions can be \n","measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is \n","not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when \n","viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of \n","the instruments. The notional amount is generally not \n","exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which derivative cash \n","flows are determined. \n","Table 14.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts and Fair Values of Derivatives \n","December 31, 2023 \n","December 31, 2022 \n","Fair value \n","Fair value \n","(in millions) \n","Notional \n","or contractual \n","amount \n","Derivative \n","assets \n","Derivative \n","liabilities \n","Notional \n","or contractual \n","amount \n","Derivative \n","assets \n","Derivative \n","liabilities \n","Derivatives designated as hedging instruments \n","Interest rate contracts \n","$ \n","357,096 \n","639 \n","570 \n","263,876 \n","670 \n","579 \n","Commodity contracts \n","2,600 \n","24 \n","12 \n","1,681 \n","9 \n","25 \n","Foreign exchange contracts \n","4,193 \n","60 \n","395 \n","15,544 \n","161 \n","1,015 \n","Total derivatives designated as qualifying hedging instruments \n","723 \n","977 \n","840 \n","1,619 \n","Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments \n","Interest rate contracts \n","10,409,720 \n","31,806 \n","36,312 \n","10,222,027 \n","40,416 \n","42,894 \n","Commodity contracts \n","88,491 \n","2,717 \n","2,734 \n","96,001 \n","5,991 \n","3,420 \n","Equity contracts (1) \n","438,458 \n","13,305 \n","13,810 \n","393,753 \n","9,573 \n","8,254 \n","Foreign exchange contracts \n","2,273,383 \n","24,707 \n","26,762 \n","1,513,363 \n","22,052 \n","25,671 \n","Credit contracts \n","60,439 \n","113 \n","44 \n","45,649 \n","66 \n","36 \n","Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments \n","72,648 \n","79,662 \n","78,098 \n","80,275 \n","Total derivatives before netting \n","73,371 \n","80,639 \n","78,938 \n","81,894 \n","Netting \n","(55,148) \n","(62,144) \n","(56,164) \n","(61,827) \n","Total \n","$ \n","18,223 \n","18,495 \n","22,774 \n","20,067 \n","(1) \n","In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a \n","recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading \n","or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 15.1 in this Note. \n","Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments \n","on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments \n","typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value \n","(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or \n","application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable \n","equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring \n","basis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in \n","Table 15.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that \n","are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities \n","carried at amortized cost. \n","FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We classify our assets and liabilities \n","recorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value \n","hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations \n","based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \n","lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on \n","significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of \n","Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed \n","description of the fair value hierarchy. \n","In the determination of the classification of financial \n","instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we \n","consider all available information, including observable market \n","data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our \n","understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs \n","used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific \n","facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument \n","category and judgments are made regarding the significance of \n","the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value \n","measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \n","considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \n","We do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \n","fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value \n","(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to \n","measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published \n","NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy. \n","Assets \n","TRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded \n","at fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using \n","internal trader prices that are subject to independent price \n","verification procedures, which includes comparing internal trader \n","prices against multiple independent pricing sources, such as \n","prices obtained from third-party pricing services, observed \n","trades, and other approved market data. These pricing services \n","compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing \n","for similar securities when no price is observable. We review \n","pricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine \n","if observable market information is being used versus \n","unobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an \n","internal trader price, compared with other independent pricing \n","sources, considerations include the range and quality of available \n","information and observability of trade data. These sources are \n","used to evaluate the reasonableness of a trader price; however, \n","valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from \n","knowledge of a particular market. Substantially all of our trading \n","debt securities are recorded using internal trader prices. \n","AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are \n","recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value \n","measurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various \n","sources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices \n","in active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary \n","markets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such \n","securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing \n","services and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from \n","independent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. \n","Substantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using \n","vendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation \n","Processes – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note \n","for additional discussion of our processes when using vendor \n","prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes \n","those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value \n","hierarchy. \n","When vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be \n","adjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also \n","use internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal \n","models use discounted cash flow techniques or market \n","comparable pricing techniques. \n","LOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  LHFS generally includes originated \n","or purchased commercial and residential mortgage loans for sale \n","in the securitization or whole loan market. A significant portion \n","of residential LHFS, and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our \n","trading business, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. \n","The remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written \n","down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS \n","that are not part of our trading business is based on quoted \n","market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage \n","whole loans with similar characteristics. We may use \n","securitization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization \n","activities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market \n","conditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading \n","business is based on pending transactions when available. Where \n","market pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we \n","use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. \n","LOANS Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record \n","nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that \n","are based on the observable market price of the loan or current \n","appraised value of the collateral less costs to sell. \n","MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs)  Residential MSRs are \n","carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Commercial MSRs are \n","carried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a \n","nonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with \n","readily observable prices. We determine the fair value of MSRs \n","using a valuation model that estimates the present value of \n","expected future net servicing income. The model incorporates \n","assumptions that market participants may use in estimating \n","future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of \n","prepayment rates (including housing price volatility for \n","residential MSRs), discount rates, and cost to service (including \n","delinquency and foreclosure costs). \n","144 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","DERIVATIVES  Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring \n","basis. Other than certain exchange-traded derivatives that are \n","actively traded and valued using quoted market prices, \n","derivatives are measured using internal valuation techniques. \n","These instruments, which include derivatives traded in over-the-\n","counter (OTC) markets, with clearinghouses, and on exchanges, \n","are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, \n","depending on the significance of unobservable inputs in the \n","valuation. Valuation techniques and inputs to internal models \n","depend on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying \n","rate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is \n","based. Key inputs can include yield curves, credit curves, foreign \n","exchange rates, prepayment rates, volatility measurements and \n","correlation of certain of these inputs. \n","EQUITY SECURITIES  Marketable equity securities and certain \n","nonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account \n","for at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our \n","remaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for \n","using the equity method, cost method or measurement \n","alternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value \n","adjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying \n","value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement \n","alternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence \n","of orderly observable transactions of the same or similar \n","securities of the same issuer. \n","We use quoted prices to determine the fair value of \n","marketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. \n","Quoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable \n","equity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally \n","market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value \n","for such securities. We use all available information in making this \n","determination, which includes observable transaction prices for \n","the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing \n","services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public \n","companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, \n","we make adjustments to observed market data to reflect the \n","comparative differences between the market data and the \n","attributes of our equity security, such as differences with public \n","companies and other investment-specific considerations like \n","liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the \n","instruments. \n","OTHER ASSETS Other assets are generally recorded at amortized \n","cost, with the exception of market risk benefit assets which are \n","recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and valued at the \n","contract level using a discounted cash flow model. For the \n","remaining other assets recorded at amortized cost, we also \n","record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairment \n","or the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject \n","to nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease \n","ROU assets, foreclosed assets and physical commodities. For \n","these assets, fair value is generally based upon independent \n","market prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a \n","discounted cash flow model. \n","Liabilities \n","SHORT-SALE AND OTHER LIABILITIES  Short-sale trading liabilities \n","in our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring \n","basis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, \n","where available. When quoted prices for the same instruments \n","are not available or markets are not active, fair values are \n","estimated using recent trades of similar securities. Other \n","liabilities include market risk benefit liabilities, which are recorded \n","at fair value on a recurring basis and valued at the contract level \n","using a discounted cash flow model. \n","INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND LONG-TERM DEBT  Although \n","interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt are generally \n","recorded at amortized cost, we have elected the fair value option \n","for certain structured notes issued by our trading business. Fair \n","values for these instruments are estimated using a discounted \n","cash flow model that includes both the embedded derivative and \n","debt portions of the notes. The discount rate used in these \n","discounted cash flow models also incorporates the impact of our \n","credit spread, which is generally based on observable spreads in \n","the secondary bond market. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","145 \n","Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes \n","We generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and \n","liabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices \n","obtained from vendors. Our valuation processes vary depending \n","on which approach is utilized. \n","INTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS  Certain Level 3 fair value \n","estimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash \n","flow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the \n","inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable \n","inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic \n","performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in \n","similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be \n","implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to \n","historical experience and other third-party data where available. \n","Internal models are subject to review prescribed within our \n","model risk management policies and procedures, which include \n","model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are \n","appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist \n","to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation \n","assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, \n","including reviewing its key components, such as inputs, \n","processing components, logic or theory, output results and \n","supporting model documentation. Validation also includes \n","ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate \n","given observable market transactions or other market data \n","within the same or similar asset classes. We also have ongoing \n","monitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and \n","liabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, \n","which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models \n","continue to perform as expected, include: \n","• \n","ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions \n","and other independent market data (including pricing \n","vendors, if available); \n","• \n","back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized \n","transactions; and \n","• \n","review of modeled valuation results against expectations, \n","including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in \n","value. \n","We update model inputs and methodologies periodically to \n","reflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing \n","models are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model \n","revalidations as necessary. \n","Internal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by \n","the appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function \n","and monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. \n","Independent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, \n","provides independent oversight of model risk management, and \n","its responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, \n","and monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing \n","periodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk \n","Committee. \n","VENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS  We routinely obtain pricing \n","from third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In \n","certain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities \n","that we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve \n","and periodically review third-party vendors to assess whether \n","information obtained and valuation techniques used are \n","appropriate. This review may consist of, among other things, \n","obtaining and evaluating control reports issued and pricing \n","methodology materials distributed. We monitor and review \n","vendor prices on an ongoing basis to evaluate whether the fair \n","values are reasonable and in line with market experience in \n","similar asset classes. While the inputs used to determine fair \n","value are not provided by the pricing vendors, and therefore \n","unavailable for our review, we perform one or more of the \n","following procedures to validate the pricing information and \n","determine appropriate classification within the fair value \n","hierarchy: \n","• \n","comparison to other pricing vendors (if available); \n","• \n","variance analysis of prices; \n","• \n","corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent \n","market data, such as market transactions and relevant \n","benchmark indices; \n","• \n","review of pricing by Company personnel familiar with market \n","liquidity and other market-related conditions; and \n","• \n","investigation of prices on a specific instrument-by-\n","instrument basis. \n","Note 15:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) \n","146 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a \n","Recurring Basis \n","Table 15.1

Option models \n","estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by \n","incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price \n","of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. \n","The unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are \n","those we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset \n","or liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if \n","by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability \n","would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We \n","also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the \n","instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the \n","significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs \n","used within the valuation. Following is a description of the \n","significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. \n","• \n","Comparability adjustment – is an adjustment made to \n","observed market data, such as a transaction price to reflect \n","dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or other \n","factors used within a market valuation approach, expressed \n","as a percentage of an observed price. \n","• \n","Conversion factor – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a \n","particular instrument may be exchanged for another \n","instrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage \n","change from a specified rate. \n","• \n","Correlation factor – is the likelihood of one instrument \n","changing in price relative to another based on an established \n","relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in \n","price over a period over time. \n","• \n","Cost to service – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a \n","portfolio of loans, which includes estimates for \n","unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and \n","foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing \n","such loan portfolios. \n","• \n","Default rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not \n","collecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a \n","constant default rate (CDR). \n","• \n","Discount rate – is a rate of return used to calculate the \n","present value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at \n","the fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists \n","of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium \n","component. The benchmark rate component, for example, \n","Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or U.S. Treasury \n","rates, is generally observable within the market and is \n","necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money. \n","The risk premium component reflects the amount \n","of compensation market participants require due to the \n","uncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting \n","from risks such as credit and liquidity. \n","• \n","Fall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans \n","associated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio \n","that are likely of not funding. \n","• \n","Initial-value servicing – is the estimated value of the \n","underlying loan, including the value attributable to the \n","embedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of \n","outstanding unpaid principal balance. \n","• \n","Loss severity – is the estimated percentage of contractual \n","cash flows lost in the event of a default. \n","• \n","Multiples – are financial ratios of comparable public \n","companies, such as ratios of enterprise value or market value \n","of equity to earnings before interest, depreciation, and \n","amortization (EBITDA), revenue, net income or book value, \n","adjusted to reflect dissimilarities in operational, financial, or \n","marketability to the comparable public company used in a \n","market valuation approach. \n","• \n","Prepayment rate – is the estimated rate at which forecasted \n","prepayments of principal of the related loan or debt \n","instrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant \n","prepayment rate (CPR). \n","• \n","Volatility factor – is the extent of change in price an item is \n","estimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time \n","expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a \n","period over time. \n","• \n","Weighted average life – is the weighted average number of \n","years an investment is expected to remain outstanding \n","based on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated \n","date the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the \n","instrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing \n","of an instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not \n","contractually fixed. \n","Interrelationships and Uncertainty of Inputs Used in \n","Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements \n","Usage of the valuation techniques presented in Table 15.3 \n","requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some \n","of which represent significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, \n","changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant \n","impact on fair value. \n","Certain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a \n","directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the \n","instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair \n","value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a \n","given change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used \n","within the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in \n","one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite \n","change in another input having a potentially muted impact to the \n","overall fair value of that particular instrument. Additionally, a \n","change in one unobservable input may result in a change to \n","another unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are \n","interrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify \n","the fair value impact. \n","DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE  The internal models \n","used to determine fair value for these Level 3 instruments use \n","certain significant unobservable inputs within a discounted cash \n","flow or market comparable pricing valuation technique. Such \n","inputs include discount rate, prepayment rate, default rate, loss \n","severity, multiples, and comparability adjustment. \n","These Level 3 assets would decrease (increase) in value \n","based upon an increase (decrease) in discount rate, default rate \n","or loss severity inputs and would generally decrease (increase) in \n","Note 15:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) \n","150 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","value based upon an increase (decrease) in prepayment rate. \n","Conversely, these Level 3 assets would increase (decrease) in \n","value based upon an increase (decrease) in multiples. The \n","comparability adjustment input may have a positive or negative \n","impact on fair value depending on the change in fair value of the \n","item the comparability adjustment references. \n","Generally, a change in the assumption used for the default \n","rate is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the risk \n","premium component of the discount rate (specifically, the \n","portion related to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change \n","in the assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable \n","inputs for comparability adjustment, multiples, and loss severity \n","do not increase or decrease based on movements in the other \n","significant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 assets. \n","MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS  The discounted cash flow models \n","used to determine fair value of Level 3 residential MSRs utilize \n","certain significant unobservable inputs including prepayment \n","rate, discount rate and costs to service. An increase in any of \n","these unobservable inputs will reduce the fair value of the MSRs \n","and alternatively, a decrease in any one of these inputs would \n","result in the MSRs increasing in value. Generally, a decrease in \n","discount rates increases the value of MSRs, unless accompanied \n","by a related update to our prepayment rates. The cost to service \n","assumption generally does not increase or decrease based on \n","movements in the discount rate or the prepayment rate. The \n","sensitivity to key assumptions of our residential MSRs is \n","discussed further in Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities). \n","DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  Level 3 derivative instruments are \n","valued using market comparable pricing, option pricing and \n","discounted cash flow valuation techniques which use certain \n","unobservable inputs to determine fair value. Such inputs consist \n","of prepayment rate, default rate, loss severity, initial-value \n","servicing, fall-out factor, volatility factor, weighted average life, \n","conversion factor, and correlation factor. \n","Level 3 derivative assets (liabilities) where we are long the \n","underlying would decrease (increase) in value upon an increase \n","(decrease) in default rate, fall-out factor, conversion factor, or \n","loss severity inputs. Conversely, Level 3 derivative assets \n","(liabilities) would generally increase (decrease) in value upon an \n","increase (decrease) in prepayment rate, initial-value servicing, \n","weighted average life or volatility factor inputs. The inverse of \n","the above relationships would occur for instruments when we are \n","short the underlying. The correlation factor input may have a \n","positive or negative impact on the fair value of derivative \n","instruments depending on the change in fair value of the item \n","the correlation factor references. \n","Generally, for derivative instruments for which we are \n","subject to changes in the value of the underlying referenced \n","instrument, a change in the assumption used for default rate is \n","accompanied by directionally similar change in the risk premium \n","component of the discount rate (specifically, the portion related \n","to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change in the \n","assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable inputs for \n","loss severity, initial-value servicing, fall-out factor, volatility \n","factor, weighted average life, conversion factor, and correlation \n","factor do not increase or decrease based on movements in other \n","significant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 instruments. \n","Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a \n","Nonrecurring Basis \n","We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain \n","assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with \n","GAAP.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \n","transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \n","SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \n","generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \n","may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative \n","transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \n","forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \n","financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \n","connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \n","sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \n","we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \n","right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the \n","transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \n","below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \n","benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans \n","transferred to a VIE by a third party. \n","In connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \n","we have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which \n","may include: \n","• \n","underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently \n","making markets in those securities; \n","• \n","providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs \n","through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \n","• \n","entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \n","• \n","holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \n","• \n","acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \n","• \n","providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \n","• \n","providing seller financing to VIEs. \n","Loan Sales and Securitization Activity \n","We periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and \n","other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan \n","sale transactions. \n","MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \n","ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE  In the normal \n","course of business we sell residential and commercial mortgage \n","loans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are \n","generally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, \n","which provide certain credit guarantees to investors and \n","servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization \n","pools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association \n","(GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing \n","Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of \n","Veterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization \n","with the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The \n","GSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, \n","sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities \n","most significant to the VIE. \n","We account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \n","loan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \n","the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \n","the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \n","VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \n","purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing \n","rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option \n","to repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which \n","becomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when \n","three scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the \n","unilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and \n","a corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our \n","intent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to \n","the securitization. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded \n","assets and related liabilities of $1.0 billion and $743 million, \n","respectively, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase \n","eligible loans. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 \n","and 2021, we repurchased loans of $293 million, $2.2 billion, and \n","$4.6 billion, respectively. \n","Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \n","losses incurred due to material breaches of contractual \n","representations and warranties as well as other recourse \n","arrangements. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our liability for \n","these repurchase and recourse arrangements was $229 million \n","and $167 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to \n","loss was $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, respectively. \n","Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to \n","assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 \n","(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about \n","residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \n","servicing fees. \n","NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  In the \n","normal course of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage \n","loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. \n","Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a \n","government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest \n","holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by \n","the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred \n","loans and account for the transfers as sales. We also typically \n","retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial \n","interests issued by the VIE, such as debt securities held for \n","investment purposes. Our servicing role related to \n","nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is \n","limited to primary or master servicer. We do not consolidate the \n","VIE because the most significant decisions impacting the \n","performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer \n","or the controlling class security holder. For our residential \n","nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as \n","sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider \n","potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a \n","majority of the VIE assets. \n","WHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole loans \n","to VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of \n","financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not \n","consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the \n","most significant activities of the VIEs. \n","Table 16.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \n","the periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as \n","sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred \n","assets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds \n","and recorded servicing assets, securities, and loans. Each of these \n","interests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are \n","classified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are \n","classified as Level 2. The majority of our transfers relate to \n","residential mortgage securitizations with the GSEs or GNMA and \n","generally result in no gain or loss because the loans are measured \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","155 \n","at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, we may transfer \n","certain government insured loans that we previously \n","repurchased. These loans are carried at the lower of cost or \n","market, and we recognize gains on such transfers when the \n","market value is greater than the carrying value of the loan when \n","it is sold. \n","Table 16.1: Transfers with Continuing Involvement \n","Year ended December 31, \n","2023 \n","2022 \n","2021 \n","(in millions) \n","Residential \n","mortgages \n","Commercial \n","mortgages \n","Residential \n","mortgages \n","Commercial \n","mortgages \n","Residential \n","mortgages \n","Commercial \n","mortgages \n","Assets sold \n","$ \n","13,823 \n","8,872 \n","75,582 \n","13,735 \n","157,063 \n","18,247 \n","Proceeds from transfer (1) \n","13,823 \n","9,017 \n","75,634 \n","13,963 \n","157,852 \n","18,563 \n","Net gains (losses) on sale \n","— \n","145 \n","52 \n","228 \n","789 \n","316 \n","Continuing involvement (2): \n","Servicing rights recognized \n","$ \n","157 \n","73 \n","966 \n","128 \n","1,636 \n","166 \n","Securities recognized (3) \n","— \n","94 \n","2,062 \n","189 \n","23,188 \n","173 \n","Loans recognized \n","— \n","— \n","— \n","— \n","926 \n","— \n","(1) \n","Represents cash proceeds and the fair value of non-cash beneficial interests recognized at securitization settlement. \n","(2) \n","Represents assets or liabilities recognized at securitization settlement date related to our continuing involvement in the transferred assets. \n","(3) \n","Represents debt securities obtained at securitization settlement held for investment purposes that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.

Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $7 million and $157 million with related collateral of $27 million and $1.3 billion \n","as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n","Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss \n","that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical \n","circumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, \n","where the value of our interests and any associated collateral \n","declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table \n","17.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to \n","offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee \n","agreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of \n","expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more \n","representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum \n","exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of \n","the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if \n","applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider \n","the credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \n","For our guarantees in Table 17.1, non-investment grade \n","represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of \n","performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is \n","determined based on an external rating or an internal credit \n","grade that is below investment grade, if applicable. \n","STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue standby letters of credit, \n","which include performance and financial guarantees, for \n","customers in connection with contracts between our customers \n","and third parties. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending \n","commitments where we are obligated to make payment to a \n","third party on behalf of a customer if the customer fails to meet \n","their contractual obligations. Total maximum exposure to loss \n","includes the portion of multipurpose lending facilities for which \n","we have issued standby letters of credit under the commitments. \n","DIRECT PAY LETTERS OF CREDIT  We issue direct pay letters of \n","credit to serve as credit enhancements for certain bond \n","issuances. Beneficiaries (bond trustees) may draw upon these \n","instruments to make scheduled principal and interest payments, \n","redeem all outstanding bonds because a default event has \n","occurred, or for other reasons as permitted by the agreement. \n","LOANS AND LHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE  For certain sales and \n","securitizations of loans, predominantly to GSEs, we provide \n","recourse to the buyer for certain losses. Certain arrangements \n","require that we share in the credit risk of the loans, substantially \n","all of which are commercial real estate mortgage loans, where we \n","provide recourse up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-\n","rata basis in the event of borrower default. The maximum \n","exposure to loss represents the outstanding principal balance of \n","the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse \n","provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual \n","agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the \n","entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and \n","amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale \n","of collateral. \n","EXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES  We are members \n","of several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing \n","houses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we \n","use to clear our trades and those of our customers, including \n","customers for whom we act as sponsoring member. It is common \n","that all members in these organizations are required to \n","collectively guarantee the performance of other members of the \n","organization. Our obligations under the guarantees are generally \n","a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of \n","the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these \n","organizations. Some membership rules require members to \n","assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another \n","member’s default or from non-member default losses after \n","applying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for \n","these arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 17.1 \n","because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote. In 2023, we \n","began acting as a sponsoring member under the Fixed Income \n","160 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Clearing Corporation’s (FICC) sponsored repo service, where we \n","guarantee the performance of our clients’ obligations to the \n","FICC. We minimize our liability under these guarantees by \n","obtaining a secured interest in the collateral that our clients place \n","with the FICC. \n","OTHER GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS  We have \n","contingent performance arrangements related to various \n","customer relationships and lease transactions. We are required \n","to pay the counterparties to these agreements if third parties \n","default on certain obligations. \n","Under certain factoring arrangements, we may be required \n","to purchase trade receivables from third parties, if receivable \n","debtors default on their payment obligations. \n","We use certain third-party clearing agents to clear and settle \n","transactions on behalf of some of our institutional brokerage \n","customers. We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that \n","could occur for non-performance by our customers on \n","transactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions \n","subject to the indemnifications may include customer obligations \n","related to the settlement of margin accounts and short \n","positions, such as written call options and securities borrowing \n","transactions. \n","We record a liability for mortgage loans that we expect to \n","repurchase pursuant to various representations or warranties. \n","See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for \n","further discussion and related amounts. Additionally, when we \n","sell MSRs, we may provide indemnification for losses incurred \n","due to material breaches of contractual representations or \n","warranties as well as other recourse arrangements. \n","When we sell renewable energy tax credits, we indemnify the \n","buyers for potential future losses incurred due to the \n","disallowance or recapture of the transferred tax credits or \n","material breaches of representations and warranties. Our \n","maximum exposure for these tax credit indemnifications is \n","capped at the amount of the transferred credits. \n","We also enter into other types of indemnification \n","agreements in the ordinary course of business under which we \n","agree to indemnify third parties against any damages, losses and \n","expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings \n","arising from relationships or transactions with us. These \n","relationships or transactions include those arising from service as \n","a director or officer of the Company, underwriting agreements \n","relating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various \n","other business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent \n","of our obligations under these agreements depends entirely \n","upon the occurrence of future events, we are unable to \n","determine our potential future liability under these agreements. \n","WRITTEN OPTIONS  We enter into written foreign currency \n","options and over-the-counter written equity put options that are \n","derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. \n","Written put options give the counterparty the right to sell to us \n","an underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified \n","price by a specified date. While these derivative transactions \n","expose us to risk if the option is exercised, we manage this risk by \n","entering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the \n","underlying instrument. We offset market risk related to options \n","written to customers with cash securities or other offsetting \n","derivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these \n","contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying \n","instrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate \n","obligation under written options is based on future market \n","conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. The fair value of \n","written options represents our view of the probability that we \n","will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of \n","these written options was an asset of $178 million and a liability \n","of $15 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The \n","fair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on \n","certain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents \n","the notional value of these derivative contracts. At December 31, \n","2023, the maximum exposure to loss was $34.0 billion, with \n","$31.9 billion expiring in three years or less compared with \n","$23.4 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, \n","2022. See Note 14 (Derivatives) for additional information \n","regarding written derivative contracts. \n","MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \n","card transaction processing services through payment networks \n","directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing \n","servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is \n","accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the \n","merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in \n","connection with payment and delivery disputes between the \n","merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the \n","cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. If we are \n","unable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss \n","for the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to \n","make a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant \n","processing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in \n","connection with our merchant processing services because most \n","products and services are delivered when purchased and \n","amounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the \n","merchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with \n","these transactions by withholding future payments and requiring \n","cash or other collateral. We estimate our potential maximum \n","exposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed \n","in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a \n","charge-back transaction. As of December 31, 2023, our potential \n","maximum exposure was approximately $761.9 billion, and \n","related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were \n","insignificant. \n","GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES In the normal course of business, \n","the Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related \n","to its subsidiaries’ obligations. These obligations are included in \n","the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as \n","off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has \n","not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. \n","Additionally, the Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees \n","the payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that \n","may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, \n","Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not \n","guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The \n","guaranteed liabilities were $834 million and $948 million at \n","December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These guarantees \n","rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and \n","unsubordinated indebtedness. \n","The assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its \n","subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity \n","from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address \n","claims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent \n","under the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of \n","dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If \n","any of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct \n","creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that \n","subsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the \n","Parent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the \n","Parent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary. For additional \n","information regarding other restrictions on the Parent’s ability to \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","161 \n","receive dividends, loan payments and other funds from its \n","subsidiaries, see Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and \n","Other Restrictions). \n","OTHER COMMITMENTS We may enter into commitments to \n","purchase debt and equity securities for various business or \n","investment purposes. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we \n","had commitments to purchase debt securities of $0 and \n","$100 million, respectively, and commitments to purchase equity \n","securities of $9.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. As of \n","December 31, 2023, our commitments to purchase equity \n","securities predominantly included Federal Reserve Bank stock \n","and renewable energy investments. \n","As part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing \n","organizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity \n","to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen \n","events occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these \n","obligations are guarantees of other members’ performance and \n","accordingly are included in Table 17.1 in Other guarantees and \n","indemnifications. \n","We have commitments to enter into resale and securities \n","borrowing agreements as well as repurchase and securities \n","lending agreements with certain counterparties, including central \n","clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded contractual \n","commitments for resale and securities borrowing agreements \n","was $17.5 billion and $19.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, respectively. The amount of our unfunded contractual \n","commitments for repurchase and securities lending agreements \n","was $746 million and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, respectively. \n","Given the nature of these commitments, they are excluded \n","from Table 5.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 5 \n","(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses). \n","Note 17:  Guarantees and Other Commitments (continued) \n","162 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Note 18: Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities \n","We enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities \n","borrowing and lending agreements (collectively, “securities \n","financing activities”) typically to finance trading positions \n","(including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to cover \n","short trading positions, accommodate customers’ financing \n","needs, and settle other securities obligations. These activities are \n","conducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser \n","extent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing \n","activities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as \n","U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, \n","to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity \n","securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We \n","account for these transactions as collateralized financings in \n","which we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We \n","believe these financing transactions generally do not have \n","material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related \n","monitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements \n","involving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of \n","our commercial lending business activities. \n","OFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED \n","FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 18.1 presents resale and repurchase \n","agreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) \n","and securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to \n","master securities lending agreements (MSLA). Where legally \n","enforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, \n","in the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities \n","held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the \n","same counterparty. Collateralized financings with the same \n","counterparty are presented net on our consolidated balance \n","sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit balance sheet \n","netting. The majority of transactions subject to these \n","agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not eligible \n","for balance sheet netting. \n","Collateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, \n","such as securities or loans, and is not netted on our consolidated \n","balance sheet against the related liability. Collateral we received \n","includes securities or loans and is not recognized on our \n","consolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may \n","be increased or decreased over time to maintain certain \n","contractual thresholds, as the assets underlying each \n","arrangement fluctuate in value. For additional information on \n","collateral pledged and accepted, see Note 19 (Pledged Assets \n","and Collateral). Generally, these agreements require collateral to \n","exceed the asset or liability recognized on the balance sheet. The \n","following table includes the amount of collateral pledged or \n","received related to exposures subject to enforceable MRAs or \n","MSLAs. While these agreements are typically over-collateralized, \n","the disclosure in this table is limited to the reported amount of \n","such collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset or \n","liability for each counterparty. \n","In addition to the amounts included in Table 18.1, we also \n","have balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is disclosed \n","in Note 14 (Derivatives). \n","Table 18.1: Offsetting – Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities \n","(in millions) \n","Dec 31, \n","2023 \n","Dec 31, \n","2022 \n","Assets: \n","Resale and securities borrowing agreements \n","Gross amounts recognized \n","$ \n","129,282 \n","114,729 \n","Gross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) \n","(28,402) \n","(24,464) \n","Net amounts in consolidated balance sheet (2) \n","100,880 \n","90,265 \n","Collateral received not recognized in consolidated balance sheet (3) \n","(99,970) \n","(89,592) \n","Net amount (4) \n","$ \n","910 \n","673 \n","Liabilities: \n","Repurchase and securities lending agreements \n","Gross amounts recognized \n","$ \n","106,060 \n","55,054 \n","Gross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) \n","(28,402) \n","(24,464) \n","Net amounts in consolidated balance sheet (5) \n","77,658 \n","30,590 \n","Collateral pledged but not netted in consolidated balance sheet (6) \n","(77,529) \n","(30,383) \n","Net amount (4) \n","$ \n","129 \n","207 \n","(1) \n","Represents recognized amount of resale and repurchase agreements with counterparties subject  to enforceable MRAs that have been offset within our consolidated balance sheet. \n","(2) \n","Includes $80.4 billion and $68.0 billion classified on our consolidated balance sheet in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements at December 31, 2023 and 2022, \n","respectively.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange \n","for transferring securities as collateral and recognize an \n","obligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction’s \n","maturity. These types of transactions create risks, including \n","(1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, \n","(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below \n","the amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and \n","therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional \n","amounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity \n","on demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to \n","contractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in \n","various ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid \n","securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial \n","strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of \n","collateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase \n","amounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned \n","through the clearing and settlement process in advance of our \n","cash repayment.

Account charges include fees for periodic account \n","maintenance activities and event-driven services such as stop \n","payment fees.

Our obligation for overdraft services is \n","satisfied at the time of the overdraft.

Wire transfer \n","and other remittance fees consist of fees earned for providing \n","funds transfer services and issuing cashier’s checks and money \n","orders. Our obligation is satisfied at the time of the performance \n","of the funds transfer service or upon issuance of the cashier’s \n","check or money order.

These fees were impacted by the sales of our Corporate \n","Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management, \n","which closed in fourth quarter 2021. \n","Fees from advisory account relationships with brokerage \n","customers are charged based on a percentage of the market \n","value of the client’s assets.

However, these \n","fees are received and recognized over time during the period the \n","customer owns the shares and we remain the broker of record. \n","The amount of trailing commissions is variable based on the \n","length of time the customer holds the shares and on changes in \n","the value of the underlying assets. \n","Asset management services include managing and \n","administering assets, including mutual funds, and institutional \n","separate accounts. Fees for these services are generally \n","determined based on a tiered scale relative to the market value \n","of assets under management (AUM). In addition to AUM, we \n","have client assets under administration (AUA) that earn various \n","administrative fees which are generally based on the extent of \n","the services provided to administer the account. Services with \n","AUM and AUA-based fees are generally satisfied over time. \n","Trust services include acting as a trustee or agent for \n","personal trust and agency assets. Obligations for trust services \n","are generally satisfied over time; however, obligations for \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","169 \n","activities that are transitional in nature are satisfied at the time \n","of the transaction. \n","COMMISSIONS AND BROKERAGE SERVICES FEES are earned for \n","providing brokerage services. \n","Commissions from transactional accounts with brokerage \n","customers are earned for executing transactions at the client’s \n","direction.

Our obligation is satisfied at the time we \n","provide the service which is generally at the time of the \n","transaction. \n","INVESTMENT BANKING FEES are earned for underwriting debt and \n","equity securities, arranging syndicated loan transactions and \n","performing other advisory services. Our obligation for these \n","services is generally satisfied at closing of the transaction. \n","CARD FEES include credit and debit card interchange and network \n","revenue and various card-related fees.

Upon the FDIC’s finalization of the rule, we \n","expensed the entire estimated amount of our special assessment \n","of $1.9 billion (pre-tax), which will be paid over eight quarters \n","beginning in June 2024.

For the \n","nonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, \n","there is no minimum required contribution beyond the amount \n","needed to fund benefit payments. \n","We recognize settlement losses for our Cash Balance Plan \n","based on an assessment of whether lump sum benefit payments \n","will, in aggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its annual \n","service and interest cost (threshold). Settlement losses of \n","$221 million were recognized during 2022, representing the pro \n","rata portion of the net loss in accumulated other comprehensive \n","income (AOCI) based on the percentage reduction in the Cash \n","Balance Plan’s projected benefit obligation attributable to 2022 \n","lump sum payments (included in the “Benefits paid” line in Table \n","22.1).

Following is a description of the \n","valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. \n","Cash and Cash Equivalents – includes investments in \n","collective investment funds valued at fair value based upon the \n","fund’s NAV per share held at year end. The NAV per share is \n","quoted on a private market that is not active; however, the NAV \n","per share is based on underlying investments traded on an active \n","market. This group of assets also includes investments in \n","registered investment companies valued at the NAV per share \n","held at year end and in interest-bearing bank accounts. \n","Long Duration, Intermediate (Core), High-Yield, and \n","International Fixed Income – includes investments traded on the \n","secondary markets; prices are measured by using quoted market \n","prices for similar securities, pricing models, and discounted cash \n","flow analyses using significant inputs observable in the market \n","where available, or a combination of multiple valuation \n","techniques. This group of assets also includes highly liquid \n","government securities such as U.S. Treasuries, limited \n","partnerships valued at the NAV, registered investment \n","companies, and collective investment funds described above. \n","Domestic, Global, International and Emerging Market Stocks – \n","investments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at \n","quoted market values. This group of assets also includes \n","investments in registered investment companies and collective \n","investment funds described above. \n","Real Estate –includes investments in exchange-traded equity \n","securities, and registered investment companies described \n","above. \n","Hedge Funds / Absolute Return – includes investments in \n","collective investment funds as described above. \n","Other – insurance contracts that are stated at cash surrender \n","value. This group of assets also includes investments in \n","registered investment companies and collective investment \n","funds described above. \n","The methods described above may produce a fair value \n","calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or \n","reflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation \n","methods are appropriate and consistent with other market \n","participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions \n","to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could \n","result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. \n","Defined Contribution Retirement Plans \n","We sponsor a qualified defined contribution retirement plan, the \n","Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan). Under the \n","401(k) Plan, after 1 month of service, eligible employees may \n","contribute up to 50% of their certified compensation, subject to \n","statutory limits. \n","With some exceptions, employees with one year of service \n","who are employed in a benefit-eligible position on December 15 \n","are eligible to receive matching contributions, which are dollar for \n","dollar up to 6% of certified compensation. The 401(k) Plan also \n","includes a non-discretionary base contribution of 1% of certified \n","compensation for employees with annual compensation of less \n","than $75,000. Eligible employees are 100% vested in their \n","matching contributions and base contributions after three years \n","of service. Base and matching contributions are made annually at \n","year end.

Our responsibility is to express an \n","opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and \n","are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \n","and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \n","obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \n","error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial \n","statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, \n","on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included \n","evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation \n","of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n","Critical Audit Matters \n","The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \n","statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or \n","disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex \n","judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, \n","taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit \n","matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n","Assessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans (ACL) \n","As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s ACL as of December 31, 2023 was \n","$15.1 billion. The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk \n","characteristics and on an individual basis for those loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. The Company estimated the \n","ACL for collectively evaluated commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected \n","exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived utilizing credit loss models \n","based on historical observations of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for \n","collectively evaluated consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which estimate expected credit losses in the portfolio based on \n","historical experience of probability of default and severity of loss estimates. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic \n","variables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts \n","multiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to estimate expected credit losses. After the \n","reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the \n","forecasted economic variables based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. The Company estimated the ACL for \n","individually evaluated commercial loans using discounted cash flow (DCF) or fair value of collateral methods. A portion of the ACL is \n","comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. \n","We identified the assessment of the ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and \n","knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment \n","encompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to \n","estimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable \n","forecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for \n","qualitative factors that may not be adequately captured in the loss models. The assessment included an evaluation of the \n","186 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","conceptual soundness and performance of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models. The assessment also encompassed \n","the evaluation of the DCF and fair value of collateral methods and assumptions used to estimate the ACL for individually evaluated \n","commercial real estate (CRE) loans. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence \n","obtained. \n","The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. \n","We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of the ACL \n","estimate, including controls over the: \n","• \n","development of certain credit loss models \n","• \n","continued use and appropriateness of changes made to certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \n","• \n","performance monitoring of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \n","• \n","identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \n","• \n","development of the qualitative factors, including significant assumptions used in the measurement of certain qualitative \n","factors \n","• \n","evaluation of the DCF and fair value of collateral assessments used to determine the expected credit losses for individually \n","evaluated CRE loans \n","• \n","analysis of the ACL results, trends, and ratios. \n","We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the estimate by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the Company \n","used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals \n","with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \n","• \n","evaluating the Company’s ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n","• \n","evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development, assessment and performance testing of certain \n","credit loss models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and \n","regulatory practices \n","• \n","assessing the conceptual soundness of the credit loss models, including the selection of certain assumptions, by inspecting the \n","model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use \n","• \n","evaluating the methodology used to develop the forecasted economic scenarios, the selection of underlying assumptions and \n","the weighting of scenarios by comparing them to the Company’s business environment \n","• \n","assessing the forecasted economic scenarios through comparison to publicly available forecasts \n","• \n","testing the historical observation period and reasonable and supportable forecast periods to evaluate the length of each period \n","• \n","testing individual credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, \n","sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral \n","• \n","evaluating the methods and assumptions used to develop certain qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the ACL \n","compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying \n","quantitative models \n","• \n","evaluating the methods and assumptions used by the Company in the DCF and fair value of collateral assessments for \n","individually evaluated CRE loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any \n","relevant guarantees or underlying collateral. \n","We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the ACL estimate by evaluating the: \n","• \n","cumulative results of the audit procedures \n","• \n","qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices \n","• \n","potential bias in the accounting estimates. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","187 \n","Assessment of the residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \n","As discussed in Notes 1, 6, 15, and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s residential MSR asset as of \n","December 31, 2023 was $7.5 billion on an underlying loan servicing portfolio of $560 billion. The Company recognizes MSRs when it \n","retains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third \n","parties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a \n","valuation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, \n","which incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These \n","assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service \n","(including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late \n","fees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. \n","We identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including \n","specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs. \n","Specifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity used to evaluate the valuation model and the following assumptions because \n","they are unobservable and the sensitivity of changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the valuation (1) prepayment \n","rates, (2) discount rates, and (3) cost to service. There was also a high degree of subjectivity and potential for management bias \n","related to updates made to significant assumptions due to changes in market conditions, mortgage interest rates, or servicing \n","standards. \n","The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested \n","the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the assessment of residential MSRs, including controls over the: \n","• \n","assessment of the valuation model \n","• \n","evaluation of the significant assumptions (prepayment rates, discount rates, and cost to service) used in determining the MSR \n","fair value \n","• \n","comparison of the MSR fair value to independent appraisals. \n","We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the MSR fair value by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the \n","Company used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved valuation \n","professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \n","• \n","evaluating the design of the valuation model used to estimate the MSR fair value in accordance with relevant U.S. generally \n","accepted accounting principles \n","• \n","evaluating significant assumptions based on an analysis of backtesting results and a comparison of significant assumptions to \n","available data for comparable entities and independent appraisals \n","• \n","assessing significant assumption updates made during the year by considering backtesting results, market events, independent \n","appraisals, and other circumstances that a market participant would have expected to be incorporated in the valuation that \n","were not incorporated. \n","Assessment of goodwill impairment \n","As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance as of December 31, 2023 \n","was $25.2 billion. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or \n","circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its \n","carrying amount, including goodwill. Management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using both an income approach and \n","a market approach. The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis that incorporates assumptions including financial \n","forecasts, a terminal value based on an assumed long-term growth rate, and a discount rate. The financial forecasts include future \n","expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and considerations related to future business activities. The \n","forecasted cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from a capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of \n","equity to the reporting unit. The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies and \n","incorporates assumptions including the selection of comparable companies and a control premium representative of management’s \n","expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. \n","We identified the assessment of goodwill impairment for the Consumer Lending reporting unit, which had $7.1 billion of allocated \n","goodwill as of December 31, 2023, as a critical audit matter.A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, \n","and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the \n","evaluation of certain assumptions used in the DCF analysis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, including (1) the future \n","expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast and (2) the discount rate. \n","188 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested \n","the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s determination of the estimated fair value of the \n","Consumer Lending reporting unit, including controls related to the: \n","• \n","evaluation of the future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast assumption \n","and \n","• \n","evaluation of the discount rate assumption. \n","We evaluated the reasonableness of the financial forecast assumption for the reporting unit by evaluating historical performance \n","and economic trends. We also evaluated the consistency of the financial forecast assumption by comparing the forecast to other \n","analyses used by the Company and inquiries performed of senior management regarding the strategic plans for the reporting unit, \n","including future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities. We compared historical financial forecasts to actual \n","results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills \n","and knowledge, who assisted in: \n","• \n","evaluating the reasonableness of the financial forecast assumption for the reporting unit by comparing certain growth trends \n","for the reporting unit to publicly available data for comparable entities \n","• \n","evaluating the discount rate assumption used in the fair value determination by comparing the inputs to the discount rate to \n","publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rate and \n","• \n","evaluating the reasonableness of the total fair value through comparison to the Company’s market capitalization and analysis \n","of the resulting premium to applicable market transactions. \n","We have served as

We delivered stronger financial performance versus 2022 and we \n","continued to execute on our strategic priorities. Our results benefited from the strong economic environment, higher interest \n","rates, our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline. In addition, we are just beginning to see the impacts of \n","investments we’ve made to better serve our customers and grow more quickly. \n","We are moving forward with our risk and control work, and we are investing to build a faster-growing and a higher-returning \n","company, while we in parallel work to become more efficient. We effectively managed through an uncertain economic \n","environment in 2023 and a period of stress for certain banks. Our franchise allowed us, along with other large banks, to be a \n","source of strength for the U.S. economy during an unsettled period. All in all, I feel very good about what we accomplished in 2023 \n","and continue to be optimistic as we look forward. \n","Financial performance \n","In 2023, Wells Fargo generated $19.1 billion in net income, or $4.83 per diluted common share. We grew net income and diluted \n","earnings per share from a year ago, with higher revenue and lower expenses. \n","Our revenue increased 11% from the previous year. The higher rate environment drove strong growth in net interest income, \n","which was up 17% from a year ago. We also grew noninterest income, with strong growth in trading activities, investment banking \n","fees, and commissions and brokerage service fees, reflecting market conditions as well as the investments we’ve been making in \n","our wholesale businesses. This growth was partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking, primarily driven by our efforts to \n","simplify the home lending business, as well as lower deposit-related fees, reflecting our efforts to help customers avoid overdraft \n","fees.  \n","Expenses declined 3% from a year ago and included the impact of our efficiency initiatives, which have resulted in $10 billion of \n","gross saves over the past three years. We reduced expenses even as we incurred a $1.9 billion FDIC special assessment as a result \n","of regional bank failures early in 2023, in addition to higher severance expense, as we continued our focus on efficiency. \n","Additionally, we continued to make investments in our risk and control infrastructure and in strategic initiatives across our \n","businesses. I go into more detail on these efforts later in this letter. \n","As expected, net loan charge-offs increased from historically low levels.  We continue to closely monitor our portfolios, taking \n","credit tightening actions as appropriate. While we’ve seen credit quality deteriorate modestly, it has remained within our \n","expectations. \n","We increased our allowance for credit losses throughout the year. The change was driven by our expectations for potential losses \n","in parts of our loan portfolio, due to both changes in balances as well as our expectations for higher losses, especially in office \n","loans. As of year-end, we had approximately 11% reserved for our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) office exposure in our Corporate \n","and Investment Banking (CIB) business. As expected, losses started to materialize in our CRE office portfolio during 2023 as \n","market fundamentals remained weak. We will continue to monitor for potential losses going forward and adjust our allowance \n","accordingly. \n","Average loans outstanding increased by 2% from a year ago, with growth in the first half of the year offsetting declines later in the \n","year, reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credit-tightening actions.  Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by consumer \n","spending as well as customers continuing to migrate to higher-yielding alternatives in a rising rate environment. \n","Our capital levels remained strong while we continued to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders, including \n","increasing our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share, and we repurchased $12 billion of \n","common stock. \n","Our return on equity was 11.0%, and our return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 13.1%.1 \n","2023 economic events \n","2023 was a year of uncertain economic outcomes as high inflation caused the Federal Reserve to aggressively increase interest \n","rates while pursuing a policy of quantitative tightening. There was much talk throughout the year about whether these actions \n","1 Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, including a corresponding \n","reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the \"Financial Review - Capital Management - Tangible Common Equity\" section in this Report. \n","  2023 Annual Report      i \n","would put the economy in a recession or result in a soft landing. So far the result has been a slowing economy in an orderly \n","fashion, and the risks of a meaningful recession are diminishing. \n","We took several proactive steps to prepare for the uncertain economic outcome. While we have continued to provide credit \n","broadly, we have been actively managing credit exposure. This is important not only from a risk-management standpoint; it also \n","helps us do the right thing for our customers by extending credit based on conservative underwriting standards. Across both \n","wholesale and consumer segments, those that are on the margin are more at risk, and we have worked to identify stress early to \n","minimize negative outcomes for our customers and losses for us. Specifically: \n","• \n","In CRE, we continue to actively work to de-risk and reduce our office exposure.  Our CRE team has a rigorous monitoring \n","process, has issued additional underwriting guidance, and has implemented escalated review and approval requirements.  \n","• \n","On the consumer side, we began taking credit tightening actions in 2022, which included increasing credit score minimums \n","across our products. Over the past several years, we have launched several new credit cards, which has resulted in strong \n","new account growth and an increase in loans outstanding. The credit quality of our new accounts has remained strong and \n","initial vintage performance has been consistent with our expectations.  \n","• \n","Credit losses in our home lending portfolio remained near zero last year, but as higher home prices and interest rates have \n","raised home affordability concerns, we have taken actions, including reducing loan-to-value maximums in certain \n","geographies.  \n","• \n","The size of our auto portfolio continued to decline throughout the year as we increased minimum credit scores and \n","reduced loan-to-value and debt ratio maximums.  \n","In addition to taking these actions, we worked proactively to manage our interest risk and liquidity exposure. Banks such as ours \n","have large securities portfolios driven by the fact that we have more deposits than loans. We invest some of the difference in \n","securities and earn a market yield.  This portfolio, combined with the other assets and liabilities we hold, creates risk that should \n","be managed very carefully. We invested prudently when yields were low. By doing this, we forwent additional net interest income \n","in the short term, but we avoided outsized losses in our securities portfolio as rates rose. Ultimately, we have started to invest at \n","higher rates.  \n","Managing this trade-off is critical for banks as we rely on the confidence of both our customers and the markets to operate. \n","Managing our liquidity and capital is extremely important to supporting that confidence. That, in combination with a strong \n","balance sheet and diversified business model, helped us in 2023. \n","Regional bank crisis \n","Each winter when I write this letter, I review events of the prior year that distinguish it from others. There are always surprises \n","that are either economically or market driven. Our goal is to be prepared for the unknowns, which means being financially strong, \n","strategically well positioned, and having the operational and management capabilities to not just survive, but to be a source of \n","strength.  \n","We have a diversified business model, a strong balance sheet, and growing margins. Our management team is extremely capable \n","and has proven their capabilities over the past several years. The work we have done together has bolstered our position even \n","more.  \n","We believe our business model provides unique benefits that allow us to serve customers, communities and the broader economy \n","in important and differentiated ways. We are predominantly a U.S. bank, and we have scale and diversification across the country. \n","We serve a broad range of customers, from large to small and across numerous industries and wealth segments. We have a \n","diversified set of risks that we actively manage, and we seek to avoid concentrations that could be outsized for our company. Our \n","funding sources are diversified, we have a strong capital base, and as one of eight Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) in \n","the U.S., we operate with heightened regulation and supervision. This enhances our strength. \n","When there are disruptive events, the benefits of our business model become even clearer. In the first quarter of 2023, we were \n","able to support the U.S. financial system, along with ten other large banks, by utilizing our strength and liquidity to make a $5 \n","billion uninsured deposit into First Republic. This deposit helped First Republic provide liquidity to its customers and calm the \n","markets for a period of time.  \n","We were well prepared for this scenario and were viewed as a safe institution to serve customers during this period.  Our \n","customers and ultimately our communities benefit from this stability. \n","ii\n","  2023 Annual Report      iii \n","Our transformation \n","We have made significant progress in transforming Wells Fargo. We are executing on our risk and control work, we have \n","reoriented our business priorities, we have changed how we manage the company, and we have improved how we work across our \n","business. \n","2023 was an important year in our transformation. When I began as CEO of Wells Fargo in 2019, we set out a series of strategic \n","priorities, and in 2023 we continued to execute them. \n","Risk and control \n","I have been clear since I joined the company that closing gaps in Wells Fargo’s risk and control environment is our top priority. \n","Simply stated, the objective is to build a risk and control infrastructure that is appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity, \n","making our operational and compliance risk management as robust as our credit and other financial risk management has \n","historically been. \n","To get this work done, we have developed plans and have been executing them now for several years. We are completing these \n","plans with increasing confidence. We have detailed project plans that track interim deliverables, not just the dates when the work \n","is to be finalized and turned over to our regulators for validation. As we have completed these interim deliverables, our control \n","environment has become increasingly stronger. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous, ongoing effort, and as we \n","implement changes, we track effectiveness along the way. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly \n","improving our control environment – but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. \n","We are making progress because we are managing this work differently than we did historically.  We have prioritized it as the \n","most important body of work we have to accomplish at the company. We have much more effective reporting and processes in \n","place to provide appropriate oversight. We have added approximately 10,000 people across numerous risk- and control-related \n","groups and spent over $2.5 billion more in 2023 than in 2018 in these areas. Critical to our progress is the experienced people we \n","now have at the company who have the skills and commitment to complete this work.  \n","In February 2024, we reached an important milestone when the OCC announced the termination of a consent order it issued in \n","2016 regarding sales practices misconduct at the company. Since the order was put in place in 2016, we have revamped how we \n","offer and sell products and services and we have taken additional actions to protect our customers and employees. \n","The closure of this order is an important step forward and is a demonstration of what I wrote above: we have prioritized risk- and \n","control-related work, we have put substantial resources behind it, and we are seeing results. The OCC’s action is confirmation that \n","we operate much differently today around sales practices, and it is the sixth enforcement action against Wells Fargo that our \n","regulators have closed since 2019. \n","This is not to say that we are done. We remain focused on the work ahead and, again, we are moving forward with confidence. At \n","the same time, I will repeat what I’ve said in the past. Regulatory pressure on banks with longstanding issues such as ours is high \n","and until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. \n","Additionally, as we implement heightened controls and oversight, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these \n","may result in additional regulatory actions. \n","Reorienting our business mix and building higher returns through cycles \n","We continue to look at our business mix and react to changes in regulations, market dynamics and the external environment to \n","put us in a strong position to serve our customers.  We are also working more closely across the company’s business units and \n","functions than ever before. \n","Repositioning Home Lending \n","Over the past year, we have implemented a meaningfully different Home Lending business model than we had been \n","operating for decades. We made the decision to significantly downsize the business and focus on serving customers who \n","have a broader relationship with Wells Fargo, while continuing to provide support for underserved communities. \n","In some ways this decision was hard; in other ways it was easy. Having a large home lending platform had been an \n","important part of what defined Wells Fargo for a long time. We prided ourselves on helping build home ownership across \n","the United States. And for many years, the origination revenues generally increased when rates decreased, providing \n","much-needed diversification from many of the company’s other businesses, which generally earned less in lower-rate \n","environments. \n","iv\n","Our decision reflects our belief that much has changed regarding regulation, capital requirements, and reputational risk \n","for large banks who operate large home lending businesses, as well as the different standards in this space for smaller \n","banks and non-banks. Simply put, we do not believe the risk-adjusted returns and the reputation risk we bear are \n","attractive to operate the business at the scale we did previously.  \n","We still view home lending as an important product to offer our customers and we will continue to support their needs. \n","We can do this with a smaller business than we have had in the past. \n","Since we announced this change, we have exited the correspondent lending business and reduced the size of our sales \n","force. Since 2019, Wells Fargo’s home lending originations have decreased from $204 billion to $25 billion, and the \n","amount of mortgage loans we service for third parties declined by over 45%. \n","Other business simplification \n","In addition to executing on our more focused home lending strategy, we continue to look at other activities with an aim \n","toward simplifying the company. To that end, we sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain \n","Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds in 2023. \n","Our actions in 2023 to simplify the company build on other actions we took between 2019-2022. These include the \n","following: \n","• \n","Sold Wells Fargo Asset Management \n","• \n","Sold our Corporate Trust Services business \n","• \n","Sold our student lending portfolio and stopped the origination of new student loans \n","• \n","Exited our international wealth management segment \n","• \n","Sold our Canadian direct equipment finance business \n","• \n","Exited the direct Auto business \n","• \n","Stopped originating personal lines of credit \n","• \n","Sold our Institutional Retirement and Trust business \n","• \n","In addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better \n","focus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and \n","elsewhere. \n","Investing in our core businesses to better serve customers \n","We are investing more aggressively than in the past in parts of our business to better serve our customers and we \n","believe these will help produce higher risk adjusted returns over economic cycles. \n","Credit Card \n","We continue to believe that a broader credit card platform is important strategically for the company. Providing \n","credit for our customers is a core strategy for us, but being involved in payments has grown in importance. Though \n","our card business is smaller than some of our competitors, it operates with necessary scale and we have been \n","working to introduce attractive new products over the last few years. These include Active Cash®, which offers \n","customers 2% cash rewards on purchases with no limits and no annual fees; Autograph℠, which offers three-times \n","points on certain purchases; Reflect®, which offers 0% intro APR for 21 months; and, most recently, new co-branded \n","cards with Choice Hotels. \n","In total, spend on our cards grew by 15% between 2022-2023, significantly more than the industry average; our \n","credit card balances grew 13%; and credit quality remains within our expectations.  \n","These products have been well received in the marketplace because they offer clear and simple customer value \n","propositions. That’s something we’ll continue to focus on as we build our Cards business, while we also work to \n","improve our fraud capabilities, line assignments, and customer service. \n","I’m proud of the progress we’ve made and am excited about what is still to come.  \n","  2023 Annual Report      v \n","Corporate and Investment Bank \n","We are investing to build our fee-based businesses in our Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB). While historically \n","many outside of Wells Fargo have not perceived us as a bank that serves large corporate clients, in fact we have \n","relationships with approximately three-quarters of the Fortune 500. We are a significant lender and provide cash \n","management solutions for many. We have also built out our capabilities to help clients access the public markets \n","and ranked fourth in high-grade bond underwriting in 2023.2 \n","Our investments in CIB are logical extensions of what we currently do for our existing client base. They have \n","positioned us to increase our fee-based revenues with clients where we already provide significant credit, and to \n","increase our returns overall. In 2023, for example, we leveraged our leading commercial real estate franchise into a \n","number-one position in real estate investment banking.3 Importantly, feedback from our clients has been extremely \n","positive.  \n","Our investments in CIB have been disciplined, and the work has been guided by a targeted plan against certain \n","industries and product capabilities. More than 50 new senior hires have joined CIB since 2019, with many of these in \n","key coverage and product groups within Banking. We have had a particular focus in high-growth sectors, including \n","technology, media and telecommunications, as well as health care, sponsors, mergers and acquisitions, and equity \n","capital markets. \n","While it is early, the results are quite encouraging. For example, our M&A announced-volume market share and rank \n","have gone from 2.9% and number 19 in 2019 to 9.9% and number 8 in 20234. Our M&A fee market share and rank \n","have gone from 1.6% and number 20 in 2019 to 2.0% and number 14 in 2023.5 We have led numerous significant \n","transactions over the past two years. And Wells Fargo’s overall investment banking share has moved up two ranks in \n","the U.S. since 2019, from number 8 to number 6, with 3.7% share.6 \n","We are also investing in our trading activities, with a focus on technology and serving our institutional client base. \n","We have enhanced our electronic trading platform by  upgrading quantitative hedging methods and trading \n","algorithms, expanding product offerings, and improving platform scalability. Expanded technology offerings also \n","attracted more clients to our foreign exchange (FX) platform, and our FX market share ended the year at #4, with \n","5.4% share.7  Investments in Equity Research have also resulted in improvements in our 2023 Institutional Investor \n","All American Research Ranking; we achieved a #7 (tie) rank, up 3 spots from the prior year.8 Overall Markets \n","achieved a #6 rank in the Americas.9 \n","Commercial Bank \n","We are a leader in U.S. middle-market banking and we are focused on finding ways to provide additional support for \n","clients. In 2023, we announced that we had entered into a strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners, \n","focused on direct lending to non-sponsor North American middle-market companies. Centerbridge has since \n","launched Overland Advisors to manage a newly formed business development company that will be primarily \n","focused on making senior secured loans, and Wells Fargo can refer clients to Overland Advisors for evaluation of \n","possible alternative financing options. \n","Providing our middle-market clients with greater access to capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of \n","growth and value creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions should be an important differentiator. It \n","will help strengthen our client relationships while adding fee-based revenue to Wells Fargo.                 \n","2 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","3 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","4 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","5 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","6 Source: Share & Rank as per Dealogic; data as of 1/05/2024.\n","7 Source: Coalition Greenwich Competitor Analytics – Americas FY23.

We have revamped how we offer and sell products; we have put in \n","place new systems, processes, and controls across the retail bank; and we have established stronger oversight. \n","In parallel to these risk- and control-focused changes, we have worked to build the foundation to grow our business \n","and improve the customer experience both digitally and in our branches.  \n","Digital \n","We continued to enhance our consumer banking mobile app in 2023, which is driving mobile adoption \n","momentum. We added 1.6 million mobile active customers in 2023 and increased mobile logins 11% from \n","a year ago.  \n","We introduced FargoTM, our new AI-powered virtual assistant, in April of last year, and in the third quarter \n","we expanded its capabilities to allow customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish. Consumers \n","interacted over 21 million times last year with Fargo. \n","We expect our digital interactions to grow further this year, as we continue to help our customers utilize \n","banking services in a quicker, more accessible way than they have in the past. \n","Branch network \n","Wells Fargo has one of the largest branch networks in the nation, with over 4,000 locations across the \n","country. We operate branches in 24 of the 30 largest markets, we cover more rural markets than many \n","large banks, and nearly 30% of our branches are in low- or moderate-income U.S. Census tracts. \n","As our customers continue to shift to digital channels, we reduced our total number of branches by over \n","280, or 6%, from a year ago, but that does not mean we are moving away from branches. In fact, it’s the \n","opposite. Branches remain critical to the work we do as a company. To that end: \n","• \n","We are refurbishing our existing branches as part of an accelerated multi-year effort to transform \n","and refresh our branch network. \n","• \n","We are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches, creating a fast and easy \n","experience for our customers. \n","• \n","We are investing in new branches. In October 2023, for example, we announced that we are \n","growing our retail branch footprint in Chicago from seven to at least 30 branches in the coming \n","years. \n","• \n","We are expanding Wells Fargo Premier, which provides tailored services to clients with high \n","qualifying balances.  \n","Other products and services \n","vi\n","We continue to look for ways to support our customers with our products, features and services. \n","We rolled out Early Pay Day in 2022, which makes eligible direct deposits available to customers up to two \n","days early, with no fee. In 2023, this enhancement provided customers early access to over $800 billion in \n","direct deposits. \n","We’ve introduced Extra Day Grace, which gives customers an extra business day to make deposits and \n","avoid overdraft fees. It benefitted over 5 million customers in 2023, helping them avoid over $750 million \n","in overdraft fees.  \n","In the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Flex Loan, a digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible \n","customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Customer response continues to exceed our \n","expectations, and we originated over 350,000 loans last year. \n","Wealth and Investment Management \n","When I arrived at Wells Fargo in 2019, it was clear that our Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) business \n","had significant opportunity to grow, and, today, it is on the right path. \n","  2023 Annual Report      vii \n","In 2023, attrition remained low and we continued our focus of hiring experienced advisors across our multi-channel \n","offering – a differentiator for the business. We offer a traditional wirehouse option for advisors; a bank-based \n","channel which allows customers in our nationwide bank branches to forge a relationship with an advisor; and \n","independent channels comprised of Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network and First Clearing, our clearing and \n","custody services for broker-dealers and registered investment advisors. \n","As we expand the ranks of our financial advisors, we continue to invest in the business. In 2023, we expanded client \n","access to high-yield products. We modernized our advisor platform, making it easier for our financial advisors to \n","serve their clients. And we continue to focus on digital enhancements. One example is Stock Fractions, giving \n","WellsTrade® clients the ability to buy fractions of a company’s stock to help build a diversified portfolio, regardless \n","of stock price. \n","Investing in infrastructure \n","Technology is a key driver of progress across our businesses. We have built new capabilities with more modern \n","technologies over the past several years – and these will benefit our wholesale and consumer customers as well as our \n","employees. Examples include: \n","• \n","Modernization of our core banking systems, with a new pricing platform and customer information management \n","system \n","• \n","Continued work to digitize lending origination and servicing platforms for Small Business, Commercial Banking, \n","and CIB clients \n","• \n","Enabling the modernization and advancement of the enterprise-wide, global payments capabilities creating \n","optimized flow of payments, improving operational efficiency, and preparing for potential changes in the market \n","• \n","Working to launch VantageSM, our new digital channel for Commercial Banking and CIB clients to perform real-\n","time payments, automated clearing house, lending servicing, and FX transactions \n","• \n","Refreshing our auto-lending decisioning platform \n","• \n","Building modern data centers and executing on our hybrid cloud strategy to enable business agility and \n","efficiencies \n","• \n","Modernizing our software development processes \n","Increasing efficiency \n","We continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives, including bringing down headcount every quarter since the \n","third quarter of 2020 and, as noted above, meaningfully reducing the number of retail bank branches as we’ve steadily \n","improved our digital offerings. We also benefitted from contract efficiencies and infrastructure optimization in our \n","Technology group. We continue to believe opportunities exist for ongoing efficiency improvements. \n","More on changes over the past five years \n","The above sections paint a picture of progress we’ve made on numerous fronts over the past several years. In this section I want \n","to take a step back and look at some data that quantifies our progress broadly. \n","When I arrived at the company in 2019, two things were clear. \n","One, we had to preserve much of what made Wells Fargo such a great place historically: the dedication of our employees, the \n","company’s longstanding commitment to our communities, and the ability to serve our customers on a highly local basis. Wells \n","Fargo’s presence in local communities has always been and continues to be a differentiator for us. \n","Two, while we had to preserve all of this, we also had to make substantial changes to the way we operate. Five years later, we have \n","done so: \n","• \n","We are a simpler company, both in terms of the businesses we have exited and the size of our employee base, which has \n","shrunk by approximately 50,000, or approximately 18%, since second quarter 2020. This has occurred even as we have \n","added approximately 10,000 employees across numerous risk- and control-related groups since 2018. \n","• \n","We are a more efficient company. Our noninterest expense has declined by over 4% since 2019. This progress comes even \n","as we have continued to invest in our risk and control infrastructure – again, with $2.5 billion more in 2023 compared with \n","2018 – as well as in significant strategic initiatives across our businesses. \n","• \n","We are a more valuable company from a shareholder perspective. Book value per common share is up approximately 22% \n","and tangible book value per common share is up approximately 23% since 201810, while common shares outstanding have \n","decreased by approximately 21%. And, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in a steady and deliberate way. \n","Impact on communities \n","We seek broad impact in our communities, and I’m proud of the work we do. As a company, we are focused on building a \n","sustainable, inclusive future for all by supporting housing affordability, small business growth, financial health, and a low-carbon \n","economy. \n","In 2023, examples of our work include: \n","• \n","Donated approximately $300 million to over 3,000 nonprofits in support of housing, small business, financial health, \n","sustainability and other community needs \n","• \n","Strengthened local communities through approximately 800,000 hours of volunteer service from Wells Fargo employees \n","• \n","As part of our Banking Inclusion Initiative, introduced HOPE Inside Centers in 15 markets now supporting 57 retail \n","branches that provide financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching \n","• \n","Exceeded our $150 million Special Purpose Credit Program (SPCP) commitment to advance racial equity in \n","homeownership, helping customers refinance their mortgages to below market rate loans with reduced closing costs \n","• \n","Launched $10,000 Homebuyer AccessSM grants that will be applied toward the down payment for eligible homebuyers \n","who currently live in or are purchasing homes in certain underserved communities \n","• \n","Expanded our commitment to housing affordability through another $20 million breakthrough challenge to advance \n","ideas addressing the need for more affordable homes \n","• \n","Announced the Invest Native Initiative, a $20 million commitment to advance economic opportunities in Native \n","communities, and have already announced nearly $11 million in grants to 28 organizations across six states \n","• \n","Committed $25 million for UnidosUS community-focused programs and nonprofit affiliate partners to advance Latino \n","homeownership, of which $10 million will support the development of the HOME (Home Ownership Means Equity) \n","initiative \n","A number of these initiatives are covered in more detail in our 2023 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, which is available on \n","Wells Fargo’s website. The report also includes a broader overview of our DE&I work at Wells Fargo. \n","In addition, although I do not cover our sustainability work in detail in this year’s letter, you can find more about progress in our \n","Sustainability and Governance Report, our July 2023 TCFD Report, and our CO2eMission reporting, which are available on our \n","website. \n","Supporting our employees \n","Our employees are our greatest asset. We value their contributions to our company, and we continue to invest in them – \n","particularly employees with lower salaries. \n","Since 2019, we have increased wages for U.S. hourly employees by nearly 20% and increased the average pay rate for tellers by \n","34%. Earlier this year, we provided a special cash bonus of $1,000 to all eligible U.S.11 employees making $75,000 or less in annual \n","salary and less than $85,000 in total cash compensation. This award went to almost 100,000 people. \n","We provide eligible U.S. employees with numerous benefits designed to protect their physical and financial health and to help \n","them make the most of their financial future. Below are several examples:  \n","• \n","Up to 85% of per-paycheck cost of medical coverage, depending on compensation level, for U.S. employees. For \n","employees earning less than $48,000, Wells Fargo has lowered medical premiums by an average of 19% over the last five \n","years. \n","• \n","Approximately $1 billion in annual 401(k) contributions, with all eligible U.S. 401(k) plan participants receiving a dollar-\n","for-dollar company match of up to 6% for eligible compensation. Eligible U.S. employees earning less than $75,000 also \n","receive a company 401(k) contribution of 1% a year of eligible compensation. \n","• \n","Back-up care benefits, family-building benefits, wellness benefits, and other benefits \n","10  Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to \n","GAAP financial measures, see the \"Financial Review - Capital Management - Tangible Common Equity\" section in this Report.\n","11 Eligible employees outside the U.S. also received a one-time cash payment, adjusted according to local compensation levels. \n","viii     \n","  2023 Annual Report      ix \n","In addition to compensation and benefits, we also provide employees with skill and capability development and career growth \n","opportunities: \n","• \n","During 2023, we invested approximately $200 million in talent development, including skill development, functional \n","training, regulatory compliance, leadership and professional development. \n","• \n","In 2022, we launched our career development framework, which provides a holistic experience that enables our \n","employees to better manage their careers within our company.

Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking \n","statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are \n","described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” \n","sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). \n","When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries \n","(consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company. See the “Glossary of Acronyms” for definitions of terms used \n","throughout this Report. \n","Financial Review \n","Overview \n","Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company \n","that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets. We provide a \n","diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products \n","and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, \n","through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer \n","Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and \n","Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. \n","Wells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune’s 2023 rankings of \n","America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and \n","third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. \n","banks at December 31, 2023. \n","Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control \n","infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \n","Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other \n","regulatory actions, some of which are described below. These \n","regulatory actions may require the Company, among other \n","things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, \n","products and services, and risk management practices. \n","Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple \n","years, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays \n","along the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely \n","to continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and \n","control infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory \n","actions. Regulators have indicated the potential for escalating \n","consequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues or \n","have repeat issues. Furthermore, issues or delays with one \n","regulatory action could affect our progress on others. Failure to \n","satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis \n","could result in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, \n","limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or \n","liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse \n","consequences, which could be significant. While we still have \n","significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects \n","of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to \n","devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong \n","business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of \n","integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. \n","Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \n","Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \n","Risk Management \n","On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order \n","with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \n","(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of \n","Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \n","the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the \n","Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the \n","Company’s compliance and operational risk management \n","program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the \n","Company works to address the consent order provisions. The \n","consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s \n","acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s \n","adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \n","third-party review of the enhancements and improvements \n","provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \n","and the plans are adopted and implemented to the satisfaction \n","of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined \n","under the consent order will be limited to the level as of \n","December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured \n","on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of \n","temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second \n","third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy \n","and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \n","Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection \n","Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \n","Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, \n","Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and \n","Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \n","On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders \n","with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the \n","Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an \n","aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters \n","regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program \n","and past practices involving certain automobile collateral \n","protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate \n","lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company \n","submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance \n","risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s \n","internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial \n","law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required \n","by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-\n","objection plans to remediate customers affected by the \n","automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage \n","interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management \n","of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The \n","Company continues to work to address the provisions of the \n","consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a \n","$250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to \n","insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s \n","April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the \n","Company’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the \n","CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would \n","terminate. \n","2 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation \n","Activities \n","On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent \n","order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the \n","execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation \n","activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent \n","order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party \n","residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain \n","mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the \n","Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is \n","provided. \n","Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile \n","Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage \n","Lending \n","On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent \n","order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer \n","remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, \n","consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain \n","practices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive \n","refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile \n","protection agreements; comply with certain business practice \n","requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a \n","$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related \n","to many of these matters were already substantially complete at \n","the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \n","order lays out a path to termination after the Company \n","completes the remainder of the required actions. \n","Retail Sales Practices Matters \n","In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \n","the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and \n","entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \n","in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \n","received products and services they did not request. As a result, it \n","remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \n","action plan that includes making things right for our customers, \n","employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \n","Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB \n","consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. On \n","February 15, 2024, the OCC announced the termination of its \n","consent order regarding retail sales practices. \n","Customer Remediation Activities \n","Our priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \n","areas or instances where customers may have experienced \n","financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \n","implement additional operational and control procedures. We are \n","working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. \n","We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \n","related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \n","may change based on additional facts and information, as well as \n","ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. We \n","had $819 million and $2.3 billion of accrued liabilities for \n","customer remediation activities as of December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, respectively. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we \n","continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we \n","have identified and may in the future identify additional items or \n","areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we \n","will continue to assess any customer harm and provide \n","remediation as appropriate. \n","Recent Developments \n","Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment \n","In November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \n","(FDIC) finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit \n","insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of 2023. \n","Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based \n","on a calculation using an insured depository institution’s (IDI) \n","estimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC’s \n","finalization of the rule, we expensed the entire estimated amount \n","of our special assessment of $1.9 billion (pre-tax), which will be \n","paid over eight quarters beginning in June 2024. The amount of \n","our special assessment may change as the FDIC determines the \n","actual losses to the deposit insurance fund and evaluates any \n","amendments by IDIs to uninsured deposit amounts reported for \n","December 31, 2022. \n","Overdraft Fees Proposal \n","On January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would \n","limit overdraft fees charged by certain banks. We expect a \n","significant reduction to our overdraft fees, which are included in \n","deposit-related fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed. \n","Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal \n","On October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would \n","reduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by \n","debit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for \n","an update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year \n","based on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card \n","issuers. We expect a significant reduction to our debit card \n","interchange fees, which are included in card fees, if the rule is \n","adopted as currently proposed. \n","Capital Matters \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","3 \n","On July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed \n","rule to implement the final components of Basel III, which would \n","impact risk-based capital requirements for certain banks. The \n","proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \n","and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \n","measurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \n","risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \n","new standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \n","new requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \n","beginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \n","increase in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \n","capital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed \n","rule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to \n","address the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet \n","and capital optimization strategies. \n","For additional information about capital planning, see the \n","“Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” \n","section in this Report. \n","Financial Performance \n","Adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \n","In first quarter 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards \n","Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – \n","Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted \n","Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. \n","We adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which \n","required revision of prior period financial statements.

All other business \n","activities that are not included in the reportable operating \n","segments have been included in Corporate. For additional \n","information, see Table 8. We define our reportable operating \n","segments by type of product and customer segment, and their \n","results are based on our management reporting process. The \n","management reporting process measures the performance of \n","the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \n","management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \n","with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \n","management. The management reporting process is based on \n","U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \n","transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \n","and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \n","consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \n","sources, which allows management to assess performance \n","consistently across the operating segments. \n","Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds \n","transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \n","liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \n","segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \n","funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \n","net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \n","credits is recognized in corporate treasury. \n","Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly \n","serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \n","providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \n","with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \n","business based on established internal revenue-sharing \n","agreements. \n","When a line of business uses a service provided by another \n","line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \n","expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \n","service provided. We periodically assess and update our revenue \n","and expense allocation methodologies. \n","Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent \n","adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \n","debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\n","equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\n","income housing and renewable energy investments are included \n","in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \n","to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \n","Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \n","Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s \n","consolidated financial results. \n","Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated \n","capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \n","on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \n","assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \n","periodically assessed and updated. Effective January 1, 2023, \n","management modified its capital allocation methodology to \n","improve alignment of allocated capital with the binding \n","regulatory constraints of the Company.

In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities \n","with a fair value of $3.7 billion to HTM debt securities in 2023 \n","due to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital \n","management purposes.

The maximum credit risk for these commitments will \n","generally be lower than the contractual amount because these \n","commitments may expire without being used or may be \n","cancelled at the customer’s request.

For additional information, see Note 16 \n","(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial \n","Statements in this Report. \n","Guarantees and Other Arrangements \n","Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make \n","payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in \n","an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are \n","generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, \n","written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing \n","house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar \n","arrangements.

For additional information, \n","see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","27 \n","Risk Management \n","Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly \n","affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the \n","expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and \n","other stakeholders. \n","Risk is Part of our Business Model.  Risk is the possibility of an \n","event occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability \n","to achieve its strategic and business objectives. The Company \n","routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its \n","customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest \n","rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, \n","such as operational (which includes compliance and model risks), \n","strategic and reputation risks. \n","Risk Profile.  The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the \n","aggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and \n","business activities after taking into consideration risk \n","management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk \n","profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. \n","Risk Capacity.  Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that \n","the Company could assume given its current level of resources \n","before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital \n","and liquidity needs. \n","Risk Appetite.  Risk appetite is the nature and level of risk the \n","Company is willing to take, within its risk capacity, while pursuing \n","its strategic and business objectives. Risk appetite is articulated \n","in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable \n","risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The \n","Company’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior \n","management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps \n","guide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company \n","continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews \n","reports which include risk appetite information and analysis. \n","Risk and Strategy.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the \n","Company’s strategic planning process, which identifies the \n","Company’s most significant opportunities and challenges, \n","develops plans to address them, evaluates the risks of those \n","plans, and articulates the resulting decisions in the form of a \n","company-wide strategic plan. The Company’s risk profile, risk \n","capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are \n","considered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with \n","the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s \n","Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates \n","in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent \n","assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM \n","also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the \n","strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk \n","management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, \n","enterprise functions, and aggregate Company levels. The \n","strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s \n","evaluation. \n","Risk and Climate Change.  The Company views climate change as \n","a global challenge that presents significant impacts for \n","businesses and communities around the world. The Company \n","expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk \n","types it manages, and the Company continues to integrate \n","climate considerations into its risk management framework as its \n","understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. \n","Risk is Managed by Everyone.  Every employee, in the course of \n","their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing \n","risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, \n","including establishing and maintaining the Company’s risk and \n","control environment. Every employee must comply with \n","applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \n","Risk and Culture.  Senior management sets the tone at the top \n","by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \n","expectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees \n","conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board is \n","responsible for holding senior management accountable for \n","establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively \n","managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak \n","up when they see something that could cause harm to the \n","Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, \n","or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s \n","responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to \n","challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their \n","concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s \n","performance management and incentive compensation \n","programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk \n","and reward under core principles that employees are expected to \n","know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources \n","Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing \n","credible challenge to the Company’s performance management \n","and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk \n","management is a central component of employee performance \n","evaluations. \n","Risk Management Framework.  The Company’s risk \n","management framework sets forth the Company’s core \n","principles for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by \n","the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. \n","Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. \n","Wells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by \n","building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We \n","continue to enhance and mature our risk management programs, \n","including operational and compliance risk management programs \n","as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s \n","April 20, 2018, consent orders. \n","Risk Governance \n","Role of the Board.  The Board oversees the Company’s business, \n","including its risk management. It assesses senior management’s \n","performance and holds senior management accountable for \n","maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management \n","program. \n","Board Committee Structure.  The Board carries out its risk \n","oversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. \n","The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk \n","management framework and oversees management’s \n","implementation of the framework, including how the Company \n","manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the \n","Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk \n","Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of \n","IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation. The Chief \n","Risk Officer (CRO) reports functionally to the Risk Committee \n","and administratively to the CEO. \n","28 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Management Committee Structure.  The Company has \n","established management committees, including those focused \n","on risk, that support management in carrying out its governance \n","and risk management responsibilities. One type of management \n","committee is a governance committee, which is a decision-\n","making body that operates for a particular purpose and may \n","report to a Board committee. \n","Each management governance committee, in accordance \n","with its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make \n","decisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging \n","risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review \n","and monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and \n","remediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key \n","challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues \n","as appropriate. \n","Table 15 presents, as of December 31, 2023, the structure \n","of the Company’s Board committees and escalation paths of \n","relevant management governance committees reporting to a \n","Board committee. \n","Table 15: Board and Relevant Management-level Governance Committee Structure \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Audit \n","Committee (1) \n","Finance \n","Committee \n","Corporate \n","Responsibility \n","Committee \n","Risk \n","Committee \n","Governance & \n","Nominating \n","Committee \n","Human \n","Resources \n","Committee \n","Management Governance Committees \n","Disclosure \n","Committee \n","Capital \n","Management \n","Committee \n","Allowance for Credit \n","Losses Approval \n","Governance \n","Committee \n","Enterprise Risk & \n","Control Committee \n","Incentive \n","Compensation \n","& Performance \n","Management \n","Committee \n","Regulatory \n","Reporting \n","Oversight \n","Committee \n","Corporate \n","Asset/Liability \n","Committee \n","Risk & Control \n","Committees \n","Recovery & \n","Resolution \n","Committee \n","Risk Type \n","Committees \n","Risk Topic \n","Committees \n","(1) \n","The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s financial statements and disclosures to shareholders and regulatory agencies; oversees the internal audit function and \n","external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and assists the Board and the Risk Committee in the oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. \n","Management Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk \n","Committee of the Board.  The Enterprise Risk & Control \n","Committee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that \n","governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives \n","information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated \n","risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC \n","also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to \n","the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives \n","regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management \n","regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s \n","assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk \n","management program. \n","The ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, with  \n","membership comprising the heads of principal lines of business \n","and certain enterprise functions. The Chief Auditor or a designee \n","attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct \n","escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also has an \n","escalation path for certain human capital risks and issues to the \n","Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate \n","directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC \n","in accordance with the Company’s escalation management \n","policy. \n","Each principal line of business and enterprise function has a \n","risk and control committee, which is a management governance \n","committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its \n","scope limited to the respective principal line of business or \n","enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider \n","risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise \n","function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line \n","of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. \n","As a complement to these risk and control committees, \n","management governance committees dedicated to specific risk \n","types and risk topics also report to the ERCC to enable more \n","comprehensive governance of risks. \n","Risk Operating Model – Roles and Responsibilities \n","The Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the \n","Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. \n","• \n","Front Line  The Front Line, which comprises principal line of \n","business and certain enterprise function activities, is the first \n","line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for \n","understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying \n","adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its \n","business activities. The Front Line identifies, measures and \n","assesses, controls, monitors, and reports on risk generated \n","by or associated with its business activities and balances risk \n","and reward in decision making while operating within the \n","Company’s risk appetite. \n","• \n","Independent Risk Management  IRM is the second line of \n","defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk \n","management program and provides oversight, including \n","challenge to and independent assessment and monitoring \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","29 \n","of, the Front Line’s execution of its risk management \n","responsibilities. \n","• \n","Internal Audit  Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is \n","responsible for acting as an independent assurance function \n","and validates that the risk management program is \n","adequately designed and functioning effectively. \n","Risk Type Classifications \n","The Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and \n","ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs \n","and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit \n","the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, \n","including emerging risk exposures. \n","Operational Risk Management \n","Operational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this \n","section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk \n","resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people \n","and systems, or from external events. \n","The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \n","responsibility for operational risk, including significant \n","supporting programs and/or policies regarding the Company’s \n","business resiliency and disaster recovery, change management, \n","data management, information security, technology, and third-\n","party risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, \n","the Board’s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant \n","operational risk policies and oversees the Company’s operational \n","risk management program. \n","At the management level, Operational Risk Management, \n","which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for operational \n","risk. Operational Risk Management reports to the CRO and \n","provides periodic reports related to operational risk to the \n","Board’s Risk Committee. Operational Risk Management’s \n","oversight responsibilities include change management risk, data \n","management risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, information \n","management risk, information security risk, technology risk, and \n","third-party risk. \n","Information Security Risk Management.  Information security \n","risk, which includes cybersecurity risk, is a significant operational \n","risk for financial institutions such as Wells Fargo and includes the \n","risk arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, \n","modification, or destruction of information or information \n","systems. \n","The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \n","responsibility for information security risk and approves the \n","Company’s information security program, which includes \n","information protection and cyber resiliency. The Risk Committee \n","receives regular reports from the Company’s Head of \n","Technology, as well as from Operational Risk Management \n","representatives, on information security risks, and the Board \n","receives a report from the Head of Technology on Wells Fargo’s \n","information security program and receives reports from \n","management on significant information security developments, \n","including certain incidents involving third parties. \n","As described above, at the management level, Operational \n","Risk Management has oversight responsibility for information \n","security risk. As a second line of defense, Operational Risk \n","Management reviews and provides guidance to the Front Line \n","technology team, including with respect to the development and \n","maintenance of risk management policies, governance \n","documents, processes, and controls, and oversees and challenges \n","the Front Line technology team’s risk assessment activities. \n","The Company’s cybersecurity team, which is part of the \n","broader technology team, provides Front Line information \n","security risk assessment and management and is responsible for \n","protecting the Company’s information systems, networks, and \n","data, including customer and employee data, through the design, \n","execution, and oversight of our information security program. \n","The technology team is led by the Company’s Head of \n","Technology, who reports to the CEO and leads our efforts to \n","manage information security and related risks across the \n","enterprise, including overseeing the Company’s Chief \n","Information Security Officer (CISO). Our Head of Technology has \n","nearly 20 years of technology and information security risk \n","management experience in the financial services industry, \n","including prior roles with Wells Fargo as Chief Information \n","Officer for the Consumer Technology group and the Enterprise \n","Functions Technology group. Prior to joining Wells Fargo, our \n","Head of Technology served as Chief Operations and Technology \n","Officer at a financing and investment solutions company, and \n","prior to that served in several technology leadership roles at large \n","financial institutions. \n","The Company has processes designed to prevent, detect, \n","mitigate, escalate, and remediate cybersecurity incidents, \n","including monitoring of the Company’s networks for actual or \n","potential attacks or breaches.

Extension terms generally range from six to \n","thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","33 \n","additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or \n","additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of \n","collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to \n","repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside \n","repayment guarantee in providing the extension. \n","Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly \n","related to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and \n","willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or \n","more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the \n","most current financial information available and is focused on \n","various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and \n","current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s \n","reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us \n","based on our analysis, as well as other lenders’ experience with \n","the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength \n","is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk \n","rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance \n","for credit losses methodology. \n","In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate \n","the collateral and future cash flows, as well as the anticipated \n","support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the \n","strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full \n","repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely \n","collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the \n","performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual \n","status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in \n","accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net \n","realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. \n","COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  Our CRE loan portfolio is \n","composed of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. The \n","total CRE loan portfolio decreased $5.2 billion from \n","December 31, 2022, as paydowns exceeded originations and \n","advances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by \n","property type.

The increase in criticized CRE \n","mortgage loans was predominantly driven by the office and \n","apartments property types.

Residential mortgage – first lien loans represented 96% of \n","the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, \n","2023, compared with 95% at December 31, 2022. \n","The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with \n","adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a \n","result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage \n","(ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that \n","limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. \n","The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. \n","ARM loans were 7% of total loans at both December 31, 2023 \n","and 2022, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for the \n","majority of this portfolio at December 31, 2023. We do not offer \n","option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage \n","products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to \n","within the financial services industry as negative amortizing \n","mortgage loans. \n","The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of \n","residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are \n","subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. \n","These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only \n","payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar \n","features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing \n","payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods \n","between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit \n","performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio \n","for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity \n","of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan \n","is delinquent. \n","The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of \n","credit was $15.0 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with \n","$18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded credit \n","commitments for these lines of credit totaled $28.6 billion at \n","December 31, 2023, compared with $35.5 billion at \n","December 31, 2022. Our residential mortgage lines of credit \n","(both first and junior lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 \n","or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options \n","available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% \n","of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. The lines \n","that enter their amortization period may experience higher \n","delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or \n","term period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL \n","for loans estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were \n","approximately 2% of total loans at both December 31, 2023 and \n","2022. \n","During the draw period, the borrower has the option of \n","converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate \n","to a fixed rate. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit \n","generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with \n","repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time \n","of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a \n","Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) \n","36 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the \n","outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The \n","conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff \n","may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect \n","some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance. As \n","borrowers near the end of their draw period, we work with them \n","to transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or \n","full repayment. \n","We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying \n","economic or market conditions for the geographic areas of our \n","residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk \n","management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio \n","includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price \n","Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models \n","(AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based \n","tools used to estimate the market value of homes. We have \n","processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk \n","management guidelines addressing the circumstances when \n","AVMs may be used. For additional information about our use of \n","appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance \n","for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, \n","current Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan to \n","collateral values (LTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan \n","portfolio. For junior lien mortgages, LTV uses the total combined \n","loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused \n","line of credit amounts). For additional information regarding \n","credit quality indicators, see Note 5 (Loans and Related \n","Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report. \n","We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist \n","homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial \n","difficulties. Under these programs, we may provide concessions \n","such as interest rate reductions, term extensions, forbearance of \n","principal, and in some cases, principal forgiveness.

Our process for \n","Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) \n","42 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting \n","Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 \n","(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial \n","Statements in this Report. \n","MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and \n","commercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) \n","government-sponsored entities (GSEs), Federal Home Loan \n","Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage \n","Association (FNMA), who include the mortgage loans in GSE-\n","guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private \n","label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase \n","mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In \n","addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential \n","mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed \n","by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We \n","may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify \n","the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the \n","securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred \n","on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of \n","contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied \n","within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of \n","the breach. \n","In connection with our sales and securitization of residential \n","mortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase \n","liability, initially at fair value, related to various representations \n","and warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for \n","loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or \n","not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of \n","factors. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \n","Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional \n","information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase \n","losses. \n","We provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage \n","loans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms \n","of certain programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of \n","actual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 17 \n","(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements \n","in this Report for additional information about our exposure to \n","loss related to these programs. \n","In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \n","servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial \n","mortgage loans included in GSE mortgage securitizations, \n","GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/ \n","VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage \n","securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by \n","institutional investors. \n","The loans we service were originated by us or by other \n","mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are \n","typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance \n","certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the \n","mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or \n","primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage \n","loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of \n","taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) \n","foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent \n","consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider \n","alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short \n","sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property \n","through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are \n","typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of \n","the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent \n","amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform \n","their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of \n","reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by \n","investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 \n","(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report for additional information about residential and \n","commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. \n","In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \n","transfer as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from \n","certain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable \n","based on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan \n","payments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to \n","repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding \n","liability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to \n","repurchase the loan. We may repurchase these loans for cash and \n","as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. \n","Loans repurchased from GNMA securitization pools that \n","regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance \n","with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future \n","GNMA loan securitization pools. At December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, these loans, which we have repurchased or have the \n","unilateral option to repurchase, were $7.8 billion and $9.8 billion, \n","respectively, which included $7.4 billion and $8.6 billion, \n","respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in \n","loans held for sale. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable \n","Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for \n","additional information about our involvement with mortgage \n","loan securitizations. \n","Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master \n","servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for \n","actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify \n","the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or \n","master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, \n","if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master \n","servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not \n","cured within a specified period. The standards governing \n","servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible \n","remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those \n","standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides \n","maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and \n","individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs \n","from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification \n","or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in \n","connection with our servicing activities, we could continue to \n","become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements \n","with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and \n","practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers \n","with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure \n","prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions \n","or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","43 \n","Asset/Liability Management \n","Asset/liability management involves measuring, monitoring and \n","managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. \n","Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides \n","with the Finance Committee of the Board, while primary \n","oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk \n","Committee of the Board. These committees oversee the \n","administration and effectiveness of financial risk management \n","policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. \n","At the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability \n","Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management \n","from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and \n","supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance \n","Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in \n","more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate \n","management level oversight specific to market risk. \n","INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is the risk that market \n","fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange \n","can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming \n","from mismatches in the cash flows of the Company’s assets and \n","liabilities generally arising from customer-related lending and \n","deposit-taking activities. We are subject to interest rate risk \n","because: \n","• \n","assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times \n","or by different amounts; \n","• \n","short-term and long-term market interest rates may change \n","independently or with different magnitudes; \n","• \n","the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \n","shorten or lengthen as interest rates change; or \n","• \n","interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on \n","loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, loan origination \n","volume, and the fair value of financial instruments and \n","MSRs. \n","We assess interest rate risk by comparing the earnings \n","outcomes from multiple interest rate scenarios that differ in the \n","direction of interest rate changes, the degree and speed of \n","interest rate changes over time, and the projected shape of the \n","yield curve. These scenarios require assumptions regarding \n","drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan \n","originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, \n","deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. We \n","periodically assess and enhance our scenarios and assumptions. \n","Our scenario assumptions reflected the following: \n","• \n","Scenarios are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our \n","assets and liabilities over time. \n","• \n","Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \n","across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \n","lower interest rates. \n","• \n","Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \n","with the changes in interest rates are held constant. \n","• \n","The funding forecast in our base scenario incorporates \n","deposit mix changes and market funding levels consistent \n","with the base interest rate trajectory. Our hypothetical \n","scenarios incorporate deposit mix that is the same as in the \n","base scenario. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer \n","deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding \n","products and/or requires additional market funding could \n","reduce the expected benefit from higher rates. \n","• \n","The interest rate sensitivity of deposits as market interest \n","rates change, referred to as deposit betas, are informed by \n","historical behavior and expectations for near-term pricing \n","strategies. Our actual experience may differ from \n","expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit \n","repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. \n","Table 30 presents the results of the estimated net interest \n","income sensitivity over the next 12 months from the multiple \n","scenarios compared with our base scenario. The base scenario is a \n","reference point used by the Company for financial planning \n","purposes. These hypothetical scenarios include instantaneous \n","movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher \n","interest rates under a parallel shift, as well as steeper and flatter \n","non-parallel changes in the yield curve. Long-term interest rates \n","are defined as all tenors three years and longer, and short-term \n","interest rates are defined as all tenors less than three years. \n","Table 30: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months \n","Using Instantaneous Movements \n","($ in billions) \n","Dec 31, 2023 \n","Dec 31, 2022 \n","Parallel shift: \n","+100 bps shift in interest rates \n","$ \n","1.8 \n","2.3 \n","-100 bps shift in interest rates \n","(2.0) \n","(1.7) \n","Steeper yield curve: \n","+100 bps shift in long-term interest rates \n","1.1 \n","0.8 \n","-100 bps shift in short-term interest rates \n","(1.0) \n","(1.0) \n","Flatter yield curve: \n","+100 bps shift in short-term interest rates \n","0.7 \n","1.5 \n","-100 bps shift in long-term interest rates \n","(1.1) \n","(0.7) \n","Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect \n","to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice \n","faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the \n","case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward \n","and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net \n","interest income. The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from \n","December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, reflected updates \n","for our expected balance sheet composition, including a shift to \n","higher cost deposits. The magnitude of the benefit, if any, from \n","higher interest rates may vary from our scenarios, including \n","because future deposit pricing and balances may be different \n","from our current expectations. The realized impact of interest \n","rate changes may also vary from our base and hypothetical \n","scenarios for various reasons, including any deposit pricing lags. \n","We use interest rate derivatives and our debt securities \n","portfolio to manage our interest rate exposures. We use \n","derivatives for asset/liability management to (i) convert cash \n","flows from selected assets and/or liabilities from floating-rate \n","payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa, (ii) reduce \n","accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) sensitivity of \n","our AFS debt securities portfolio, and/or (iii) economically hedge \n","our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and \n","MSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \n","are presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in \n","this Report. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of \n","AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the \n","amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized \n","gains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS \n","to HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the \n","life of the security with no further impact from interest rate \n","changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting \n","Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity \n","Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for \n","additional information on our debt securities portfolio. \n","44 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","In addition to the net interest income sensitivity above, we \n","also measure and evaluate the economic value sensitivity (EVS) \n","of our balance sheet. EVS is the change in the present value of \n","the life-time cash flows of the Company’s assets and liabilities \n","across a range of scenarios. It is based on the existing balance \n","sheet, at a point in time, and helps indicate whether we are \n","exposed to higher or lower interest rates. We manage EVS \n","through a set of limits that are designed to align with our interest \n","rate risk appetite. \n","Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense \n","are impacted by mortgage banking activities that may have \n","sensitivity impacts that move in the opposite direction of our net \n","interest income. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability \n","Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market \n","Risk” section in this Report for additional information. \n","Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \n","by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits \n","that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees \n","on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the \n","impact to net interest income does not include the fair value \n","changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \n","related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \n","addition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \n","noninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \n","the actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional \n","information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 \n","(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We \n","originate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \n","various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \n","risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \n","other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \n","securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage \n","loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \n","commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \n","investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \n","management activities. We may also retain securities in our \n","investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \n","Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \n","noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \n","the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan \n","commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage \n","applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \n","mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \n","the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \n","demand, as well as the time required for processing a new \n","application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \n","selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \n","on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest \n","rates. \n","The valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly \n","subjective and involve complex judgments by management \n","about matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in \n","interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions \n","captured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including \n","prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the \n","servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow \n","balances and other servicing valuation elements. See the “Critical \n","Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage \n","Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional \n","information on the valuation of our residential MSRs. \n","An increase in interest rates generally reduces the \n","propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the \n","servicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair \n","value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also \n","reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, \n","which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A \n","decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. \n","To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our \n","residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of \n","derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar \n","futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest \n","rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in \n","mortgage banking is a complex process that requires \n","sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are \n","several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking \n","related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and \n","associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of \n","volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and \n","changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to \n","balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the \n","financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the \n","values and income being hedged. \n","The size of the hedge and the particular combination of \n","hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce \n","the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a \n","range of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the \n","composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the \n","relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our \n","mortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types \n","of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and \n","rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and \n","the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. \n","For additional information on mortgage banking, including \n","key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see \n","Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and \n","Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial \n","Statements in this Report. \n","MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \n","from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest \n","rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and \n","commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to \n","counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, \n","basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the \n","trading book, mortgage servicing rights, the hedge effectiveness \n","risk associated with the mortgage book held at fair value, and \n","impairment on private equity investments. \n","The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight \n","responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s \n","market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In \n","addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight \n","responsibilities with respect to market risk, including \n","counterparty risk. The Finance Committee also reports key \n","market risk matters to the Risk Committee. \n","At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk \n","Management function, which is part of IRM, has oversight \n","responsibility for market risk across the enterprise. The Market \n","and Counterparty Risk Management function reports into \n","Corporate and Investment Banking Risk and provides periodic \n","reports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance Committee \n","and Risk Committee, as applicable. \n","MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading \n","activities to accommodate the investment and risk management \n","activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to \n","manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities \n","predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser \n","extent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","45 \n","for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans, and \n","trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading \n","activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the \n","financial instruments used in our trading activities include net \n","interest income, changes in fair value, and realized gains and \n","losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is \n","reflected in the interest income and interest expense \n","components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes \n","in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading \n","activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For \n","additional information on the financial instruments used in our \n","trading activities and the income from these trading activities, \n","see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report. \n","Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to \n","estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial \n","markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with \n","sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and \n","monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are \n","monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated \n","levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management \n","function aggregates and monitors exposures against our \n","established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are \n","analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors \n","various market risk exposure measures from a variety of \n","perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and \n","legal entity. \n","Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \n","market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The \n","Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes \n","to establish and monitor line of business and Company-wide risk \n","limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on \n","our consolidated balance sheet. \n","Table 31 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk \n","category. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation \n","model which assumes that historical changes in market values \n","are representative of the potential future outcomes and \n","measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a \n","1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical \n","simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a \n","12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a \n","12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is \n","responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence \n","level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur \n","single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on \n","average once every 100 trading days. \n","Table 31: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category \n","Year ended December 31, \n","2023 \n","2022 \n","(in millions) \n","Period \n","end \n","Average \n","Low \n","High \n","Period \n","end \n","Average \n","Low \n","High \n","Company Trading General VaR Risk Categories \n","Credit \n","$ \n","30 \n","35 \n","20 \n","52 \n","29 \n","32 \n","19 \n","85 \n","Interest rate \n","16 \n","33 \n","9 \n","65 \n","25 \n","25 \n","9 \n","88 \n","Equity \n","23 \n","21 \n","13 \n","31 \n","27 \n","23 \n","13 \n","38 \n","Commodity \n","3 \n","4 \n","2 \n","8 \n","4 \n","6 \n","2 \n","20 \n","Foreign exchange \n","1 \n","1 \n","0 \n","4 \n","1 \n","1 \n","0 \n","2 \n","Diversification benefit (1) \n","(36) \n","(59) \n","(47) \n","(52) \n","Company Trading General VaR \n","$ \n","37 \n","35 \n","39 \n","35 \n","(1) \n","The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated \n","causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on \n","different days. \n","Sensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR \n","models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity \n","analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the \n","measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% \n","increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We \n","conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, \n","volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. \n","Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication \n","of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market \n","moves. \n","Stress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to \n","adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, \n","stress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to \n","extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios \n","estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions \n","of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit \n","spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These \n","scenarios assume that the market moves happen \n","instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes \n","place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative \n","approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). \n","An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both \n","historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad \n","range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation \n","and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the \n","impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio \n","values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase \n","across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. \n","Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress \n","scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis \n","addresses how these events might affect the risk factors \n","relevant to a portfolio. \n","The Company’s stress testing framework is also used in \n","calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s \n","Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal \n","stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated \n","to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail \n","on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in \n","this Report. \n","MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly \n","affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage \n","equity investments in various businesses, such as start-up \n","companies and emerging growth companies. We also invest in \n","Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) \n","46 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","funds that make similar private equity investments. These \n","private equity investments are made within capital allocations \n","approved by management and the Board. The Board reviews \n","business developments, key risks and historical returns for the \n","private equity investment portfolio at least annually. \n","Management reviews these investments at least quarterly to \n","assess them for impairment and observable price changes. For \n","nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts \n","and circumstances of each individual investment and the \n","expectations for that investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the \n","viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable \n","price changes that are similar to the investments held. \n","Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private \n","equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair \n","value through net income, and the measurement alternative. \n","As part of our business to support our customers, we trade \n","public equities, listed/over-the-counter equity derivatives, and \n","convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these \n","activities. We also have marketable equity securities that include \n","investments relating to our venture capital activities. We manage \n","these marketable equity securities within capital risk limits \n","approved by management and the Board and monitored by \n","Corporate ALCO and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value \n","changes in these marketable equity securities are recognized in \n","net income. For additional information, see Note 4 (Equity \n","Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect \n","our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under \n","management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability \n","to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock \n","market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and \n","other business activities. Each business line monitors and \n","manages these indirect risks. \n","LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  Liquidity risk is the risk arising from \n","the inability of the Company to meet obligations when they \n","come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without \n","incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we \n","enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash \n","payments, including funding for customer loan requests, \n","customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, \n","leases for premises and equipment, and other cash \n","commitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of \n","deposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-\n","operational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity \n","management is to be able to meet our contractual obligations \n","and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal \n","operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific \n","and/or market stress. For additional information on these \n","obligations, see the following sections and Notes to Financial \n","Statements in this Report: \n","• \n","“Unfunded Credit Commitments” section within Loans and \n","Related Allowance for Credit Losses (Note 5) \n","• \n","Leasing Activity (Note 8) \n","• \n","Deposits (Note 9) \n","• \n","Long-Term Debt (Note 10) \n","• \n","Guarantees and Other Commitments (Note 17) \n","• \n","Employee Benefits (Note 22) \n","• \n","Income Taxes (Note 23) \n","To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity \n","guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover \n","potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence \n","on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are \n","monitored on a monthly basis by the management-level \n","Corporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by \n","the Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for \n","both the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that \n","the Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries. \n","Liquidity Stress Tests  Liquidity stress tests are performed to \n","help the Company maintain sufficient liquidity to meet \n","contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of \n","stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as  \n","idiosyncratic events, including a range of stress conditions and \n","time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of the \n","Company’s projected liquidity position during stress and inform \n","future needs in the Company’s funding plan. \n","Contingency Funding Plan  Our contingency funding plan (CFP), \n","which is approved by the Corporate Asset/Liability Committee \n","and the Board’s Risk Committee, sets out the Company’s \n","strategies and action plans to address potential liquidity needs \n","during market-wide or idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP \n","establishes measures for monitoring emerging liquidity events \n","and describes the processes for communicating and managing \n","stress events should they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate \n","funding and liquidity strategies available to the Company in a \n","period of stress. \n","Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, \n","OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity \n","requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) \n","established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \n","(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold \n","high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or \n","greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day \n","stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists \n","of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and \n","mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies \n","to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) \n","with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued \n","by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management \n","standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as \n","Wells Fargo. \n","We are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and \n","FDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the \n","net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking \n","organization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum \n","amount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term \n","debt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, \n","derivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon \n","period. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with \n","total assets of $10 billion or more.

Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted \n","ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets \n","and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. \n","RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company \n","is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to \n","implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking \n","organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating \n","capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced \n","Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, \n","and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both \n","approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \n","capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \n","distributions and discretionary bonus payments. \n","On July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \n","proposed rule to implement the final components of Basel III, \n","which would impact risk-based capital requirements for certain \n","banks. The proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced \n","Approach and replace it with a new expanded risk-based \n","approach for the measurement of risk-weighted assets, including \n","more granular risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk \n","framework, and a new standardized approach for measuring \n","operational risk. The new requirements would be phased in over a \n","three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects \n","a significant increase in its risk-weighted assets and a net \n","increase in its capital requirements based on an assessment of \n","the proposed rule. The Company is considering a range of \n","potential actions to address the impact of the proposed rule, \n","including balance sheet and capital optimization strategies. \n","Table 37 and Table 38 present the risk-based capital \n","requirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized \n","Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of \n","December 31, 2023. \n","Table 37: Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized Approach \n","Standardized Approach \n","8.90% \n","10.40% \n","12.40% \n","4.50% \n","6.00% \n","8.00% \n","2.90% \n","2.90% \n","2.90% \n","1.50% \n","1.50% \n","1.50% \n","Minimum requirement \n","Stress capital buffer \n","G-SIB capital surcharge \n","Common Equity Tier 1 \n","(CET1) ratio \n","Tier 1 capital ratio \n","Total capital ratio \n","Table 38: Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Advanced Approach \n","Advanced Approach \n","8.50% \n","10.00% \n","12.00% \n","4.50% \n","6.00% \n","8.00% \n","2.50% \n","2.50% \n","2.50% \n","1.50% \n","1.50% \n","1.50% \n","Minimum requirement \n","Capital conservation buffer \n","G-SIB capital surcharge \n","Common Equity Tier 1 \n","(CET1) ratio \n","Tier 1 capital ratio \n","Total capital ratio \n","In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described \n","in Table 37 and Table 38, if the FRB determines that a period of \n","excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic \n","risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the \n","risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking \n","regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at December 31, \n","2023, was 0.00%. \n","The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain \n","institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach \n","and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or \n","financial stress. \n","The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease \n","in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse \n","scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related \n","Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four \n","quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress \n","capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ \n","over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based \n","capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are \n","subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for \n","the period October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, is \n","2.90%. \n","50 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also \n","subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital \n","surcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio \n","requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually \n","calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher \n","of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers \n","our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, \n","substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the \n","methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability \n","Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar \n","inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term \n","wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges \n","than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is \n","calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the \n","amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If \n","our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital \n","surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our \n","annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital \n","surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our \n","G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2024. On \n","July 27, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would impact \n","the methodology used to calculate the G-SIB capital surcharge. \n","Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets \n","and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance \n","sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories \n","according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the \n","nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk \n","category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with \n","that category.

As of December 31, 2023, these broker-dealer \n","subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory \n","minimum net capital requirements. \n","Capital Planning and Stress Testing \n","Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet \n","regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-\n","term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow \n","our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying \n","environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return \n","capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital \n","structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital \n","requirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the \n","stress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory \n","requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, \n","changes in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our \n","long-term target capital levels are set above their respective \n","regulatory minimums plus buffers. \n","The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \n","other requirements that govern capital distributions, including \n","dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \n","Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \n","financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \n","when evaluating their capital plans. \n","As part of the annual CCAR, the FRB generates a supervisory \n","stress test. The FRB reviews the supervisory stress test results as \n","required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of \n","capital actions for all large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s \n","proposed capital actions. \n","Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and \n","banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the \n","institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during \n","periods of adverse economic and financial conditions. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","55 \n","Securities Repurchases \n","On July 25, 2023 we announced that our Board authorized a \n","common stock repurchase program of up to $30 billion. Unless \n","modified or revoked by the Board, this authorization does not \n","expire and is our only common stock repurchase program in \n","effect. At December 31, 2023, we had remaining Board authority \n","to repurchase up to approximately $26.7 billion of common \n","stock. \n","Various factors impact the amount and timing of our share \n","repurchases, including the earnings, cash requirements and \n","financial condition of the Company, the impact to our balance \n","sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements \n","and long-term targeted capital structure, the results of \n","supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading \n","price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, \n","including regulatory requirements under the FRB’s capital plan \n","rule. Although we announce when the Board authorizes a share \n","repurchase program, we typically do not give any public notice \n","before we repurchase our shares. Due to the various factors that \n","may impact the amount and timing of our share repurchases and \n","the fact that we may be in the market throughout the year, our \n","share repurchases occur at various prices. We may suspend share \n","repurchase activity at any time. \n","Furthermore, the Company has a variety of benefit plans in \n","which employees may own or obtain shares of our common \n","stock. The Company may buy shares from these plans to \n","accommodate employee preferences and these purchases are \n","subtracted from our repurchase authority. \n","For additional information about share repurchases during \n","fourth quarter 2023, see Part II, Item 5 in our 2023 Form 10-K. \n","Regulatory Matters \n","The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant \n","regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation \n","and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services \n","companies conduct business and may continue to result in \n","increased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights \n","the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight \n","initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For \n","additional information about the regulatory matters discussed \n","below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, \n","see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2023 Form \n","10-K, and the “Overview,” “Capital Management,” “Forward-\n","Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 26 \n","(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Dodd-Frank Act \n","The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform \n","legislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional \n","information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its \n","rulemaking initiatives. \n","• \n","Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important \n","firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal \n","banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and \n","regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. \n","The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing \n","enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding \n","companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based \n","capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single \n","counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity \n","limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave \n","threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB \n","and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress \n","testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. \n","Furthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and \n","the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the \n","FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of \n","directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, \n","has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance \n","and risk management standards for large national banks \n","such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require \n","covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk \n","governance framework to manage and control their risk-\n","taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and \n","responsibilities for risk management practices within \n","covered banks and create certain risk oversight \n","responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to \n","the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory \n","requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-\n","Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight \n","Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may \n","recommend new systemic risk management requirements \n","and require new reporting of systemic risks. \n","• \n","Regulation of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank \n","Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n","(CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate \n","disclosures regarding financial products and are protected \n","from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has \n","issued and proposed a number of rules impacting consumer \n","financial products, including rules impacting residential \n","mortgage lending, credit cards, and other financial products \n","and banking related activities, as well as the fees that may be \n","charged for certain banking products and services. In \n","addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is \n","continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of \n","the financial services industry with respect to a number of \n","consumer businesses and products, including mortgage \n","lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto \n","finance. \n","• \n","Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities.  The \n","Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for \n","regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to \n","authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity \n","Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and \n","Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive \n","sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, \n","respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory \n","agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared \n","swaps and security-based swaps. As a registered swap dealer \n","and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, \n","Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, \n","as well as others adopted or under consideration by \n","regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may \n","negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter \n","derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new \n","derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may \n","increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based \n","swaps, and other derivatives activities. \n","Regulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements \n","The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various \n","regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the \n","FRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules \n","Capital Management (continued) \n","56 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-\n","based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The \n","Company and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified \n","leverage and supplementary leverage ratios. In addition, the \n","Company is required to have a minimum amount of total loss \n","absorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. \n","Federal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a \n","liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For \n","additional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage \n","and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable \n","to us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – \n","Liquidity Standards” sections in this Report. \n","“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters \n","Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank \n","Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to \n","prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as \n","“living wills,” designed to facilitate their rapid and orderly \n","resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. \n","Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a \n","reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the \n","U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable \n","period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the \n","risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the \n","financial stability of the United States. In addition to the \n","Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, \n","Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare \n","and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC \n","determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may \n","impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements \n","on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we \n","adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC \n","ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any \n","deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or \n","operations. On June 27, 2023, we submitted our most recent \n","resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. \n","If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \n","proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \n","regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly \n","liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for \n","the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically \n","important financial institution that is in default or in danger of \n","default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution \n","under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse \n","effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is \n","appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation \n","authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would \n","determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and \n","obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation \n","authority requires that security holders of a company in \n","receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to \n","any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of \n","creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. \n","Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the \n","strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \n","in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims \n","procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ \n","claims. \n"," The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \n","a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \n","only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. \n","However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \n","binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, \n","whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the \n","FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has \n","announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a \n","desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly \n","liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might \n","exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is \n","possible. \n","To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important \n","financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal \n","banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, \n","maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to \n","absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal \n","banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the \n","continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding \n","the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on \n","parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging \n","institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital \n","and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an \n","orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to \n","facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, \n","2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended \n","and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with \n","WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and \n","subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo \n","Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC \n","(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated \n","from time to time as material entities for resolution planning \n","purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time \n","as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related \n","Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the \n","Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including \n","the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and \n","intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its \n","subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will \n","continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time \n","to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, \n","the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide \n","capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered \n","Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support \n","Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the \n","Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of \n","credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected \n","to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating \n","conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its \n","debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other \n","obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these \n","arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ \n","or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s \n","board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. \n","Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the \n","committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to \n","pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which \n","could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and \n","its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could \n","result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the \n","Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if \n","the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective \n","obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, \n","the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant \n","to a related security agreement. \n","In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \n","periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a \n","range of options that we may consider during times of \n","idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial \n","weaknesses and restore market confidence without \n","extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","57 \n","possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan \n","portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and \n","periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the \n","Bank’s plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is \n","experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has \n","not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution \n","is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our \n","recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on \n","our business or ultimately require us to divest assets. \n","Other Regulatory Related Matters \n","• \n","Regulatory actions.  The Company is subject to a number of \n","consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may \n","require the Company, among other things, to undertake \n","certain changes to its business, operations, products and \n","services, and risk management practices, and include the \n","following: \n","◦ \n","Consent Orders Discussed in the “Overview” Section in this \n","Report.  For a discussion of certain consent orders \n","applicable to the Company, see the “Overview” section \n","in this Report. \n","◦ \n","OCC approval of director and senior executive officer \n","appointments and certain post-termination payments.  \n","Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, \n","Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements \n","that were originally imposed in November 2016 to \n","provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-\n","objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in \n","directors and senior executive officers, and remains \n","subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-\n","termination payments to certain individuals and \n","employees. \n","• \n","Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change.  \n","Federal, state, and non-U.S. governments and government \n","agencies have demonstrated increased attention to the \n","impacts and potential risks associated with climate change. \n","For example, federal banking regulators are reviewing the \n","implications of climate change on the financial stability of \n","the United States and have issued guidance on the \n","identification and management by large banks of climate-\n","related financial risks. In addition, the SEC has proposed \n","rules that would require public companies to disclose certain \n","climate-related information, including greenhouse gas \n","emissions, climate-related targets and goals, and \n","governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk \n","management processes. Similarly, California’s state \n","legislature finalized climate-related disclosure laws, while \n","the European Union finalized its Corporate Sustainability \n","Reporting Directive. The approaches taken by various \n","governments and government agencies can vary \n","significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any \n","current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to \n","climate change and its impacts could require us to change \n","certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and \n","earnings, impose additional costs on us, subject us to legal or \n","regulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our \n","business operations and/or competitive position. \n","Regulatory Matters (continued) \n","58 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Critical Accounting Policies \n","Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of \n","Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of \n","operations and financial condition because they require that we \n","use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our \n","assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are \n","critical because they require management to make difficult, \n","subjective and complex judgments about matters that are \n","inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially \n","different amounts would be reported under different conditions \n","or using different assumptions. These policies govern: \n","• \n","the allowance for credit losses; \n","• \n","the valuation of residential MSRs; \n","• \n","the fair value of financial instruments; \n","• \n","income taxes; \n","• \n","liability for legal actions; and \n","• \n","goodwill impairment. \n","Management has discussed these critical accounting policies \n","and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit \n","Committee. \n","Allowance for Credit Losses \n","We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which \n","is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the \n","loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance \n","sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments \n","carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an \n","ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other \n","financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in \n","leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For \n","additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \n","Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance \n","for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured \n","based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset \n","(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as \n","appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options \n","using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted \n","information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a \n","discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference \n","between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. \n","Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision \n","for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the \n","judgment and review required to determine the ACL, \n","management considerations include the evaluation of past \n","events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and \n","conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the \n","initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to \n","time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business or \n","investment strategy, or products or product mix may result in a \n","corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our \n","methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial \n","asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio \n","segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available \n","to absorb credit losses of the Company. \n","Judgment is specifically applied in: \n","• \n","Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast \n","period.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to \n","estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables \n","include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, \n","and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic \n","variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some \n","economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, \n","for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for \n","unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real \n","estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the \n","initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period \n","to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast \n","multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base \n","scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more \n","pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises \n","judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios \n","that are used to estimate future credit losses. \n","• \n","Reversion to historical loss expectations.  Our long-term \n","average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the \n","long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the \n","forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages \n","are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. \n","The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is \n","assessed on a quarterly basis. \n","• \n","Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, \n","unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually \n","assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit \n","variables in our modeled approaches to help assess \n","probability of default and loss given default. Borrower \n","quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial \n","strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default \n","curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted \n","collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted \n","severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk \n","ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers \n","and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk \n","specialists. \n","• \n","Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally \n","developed models that incorporate credit attributes and \n","economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. \n","Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in \n","the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and \n","variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are \n","independently validated in accordance with the Company’s \n","policies. We routinely assess our model performance and \n","apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy \n","of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations \n","against the company-wide risk inventory to help \n","appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our \n","estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as \n","needed. \n","• \n","Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is \n","utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial \n","asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply \n","judgment when valuing the collateral either through \n","appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or \n","other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral \n","valuations support incremental ACL or charge-downs and \n","increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a \n","negative allowance when the financial asset has been \n","previously written-down below current recovery value. \n","• \n","Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual \n","term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and \n","certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We \n","extend the contractual term when we are not able to \n","unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension \n","options. Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","59 \n","which requires that we determine a contractual life by \n","estimating the application of future payments to the \n","outstanding loan amount. \n","• \n","Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in \n","the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s \n","judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions \n","used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic \n","environmental factors, modeling assumptions and \n","performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, \n","including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \n","Sensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key \n","assumptions which requires significant management judgment. \n","Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of \n","factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality, \n","and general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted \n","economic variables used could have varying impacts on different \n","financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous \n","credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variables \n","such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which \n","may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in \n","opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. \n","Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s \n","view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We \n","applied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our \n","sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic \n","deterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the \n","duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables \n","within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a \n","hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately \n","$6.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The hypothetical increase in \n","our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of \n","management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the \n","current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative \n","effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar \n","sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. \n","The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities \n","and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall \n","ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for \n","loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. \n","Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights \n","(MSRs) \n","MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage \n","loans for others. We generally recognize MSRs when we retain \n","servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of \n","loans we originate. We carry our MSRs related to residential \n","mortgage loans at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential \n","MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential \n","MSRs are reflected in earnings. \n","We use models to estimate the fair value of our residential \n","MSRs. The models are independently validated in accordance \n","with Company policies. Collectively, the models are used to \n","calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing \n","income and incorporate inputs and assumptions that market \n","participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs \n","and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and \n","require judgment to determine. If observable market indications \n","do become available, these are factored into the estimates as \n","appropriate. Significant inputs and assumptions requiring \n","management judgement include: \n","• \n","The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future \n","net servicing income.  The prepayment rate is the annual rate \n","at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage \n","loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower \n","defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and \n","borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in \n","mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. \n","• \n","The discount rate used to present value estimated future net \n","servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of \n","return investors in the market would expect for an asset \n","with similar risk and is estimated using a dynamic \n","methodology for market curves and volatility. To determine \n","the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for \n","uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from \n","servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future \n","servicing costs and earnings on escrow accounts). \n","• \n","The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net \n","servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes \n","estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency \n","and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of \n","defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service \n","loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market \n","participant’s view for our estimated cost to service and our \n","actual costs may vary from that estimate. \n","Both prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, \n","and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and \n","mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in \n","either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results \n","in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in \n","either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of \n","the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-\n","driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount \n","rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the \n","future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in \n","servicing standards as well as changes in individual state \n","foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant \n","information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an \n","impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation \n","in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value \n","estimate to independent appraisals. \n","For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, \n","see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 \n","(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets \n","and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \n","Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Fair Value of Financial Instruments \n","Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a \n","financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly \n","transaction between market participants at the measurement \n","date. \n","We use fair value measurements to comply with both \n","recognition and disclosure requirements. For example, assets and \n","liabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, \n","AFS debt securities, and derivatives are recorded at fair value on \n","our consolidated balance sheet each period. Other financial \n","instruments, such as loans held for investment and substantially \n","all nonmarketable equity securities are not recorded at fair value \n","each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments \n","through the application of an accounting method such as lower \n","of cost or fair value (LOCOM), write-downs of individual assets, \n","or application of the measurement alternative for certain \n","nonmarketable equity securities. We also disclose our estimate \n","of fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, \n","such as HTM debt securities, loans held for investment, and long-\n","term debt. \n","Disclosure of fair value measurements for assets and \n","liabilities are made using a three-level hierarchy. The \n","Critical Accounting Policies (continued) \n","60 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based \n","on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for \n","measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs \n","reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained \n","from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our \n","estimates about market data. \n","When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the \n","use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \n","inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to \n","measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not \n","available, fair value measurement is based upon models that \n","generally use market-based or independently sourced market \n","parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment \n","rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when \n","observable market data is limited or not available, fair value \n","estimates are typically determined using internal models based \n","on unobservable inputs. These models are independently \n","validated in accordance with the Company’s policies. Additionally, \n","we obtain pricing information from third-party vendors to record \n","fair values and to corroborate internal prices. Third-party \n","validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of \n","prices received. \n","When using internal models based on unobservable inputs, \n","management judgment is necessary as we make judgments \n","about significant assumptions that market participants would \n","use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions \n","includes consideration of many factors, including market \n","conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, \n","such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in \n","secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and \n","reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine \n","fair value. In such cases, adjustments to available quoted prices or \n","observable market data may be required. For example, we may \n","adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using \n","internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact \n","of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair \n","value measurement. \n","We continually assess the level and volume of market \n","activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining \n","adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions \n","can change over time, our determination of which securities \n","markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we \n","determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted \n","prices require adjustment may also change. \n","Significant judgment is also applied in the determination of \n","whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as \n","Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this \n","judgment, we consider available information, including \n","observable market data, indications of market liquidity and \n","orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques \n","and significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The \n","classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts \n","and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category \n","and judgments are made regarding the significance of \n","unobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value \n","measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \n","considered significant to the fair value measurement, the \n","instrument is classified as Level 3. \n","Table 48 presents our (i) assets and liabilities recorded at fair \n","value on a recurring basis and (ii) Level 3 assets and liabilities \n","recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, both presented as a \n","percentage of our total assets and total liabilities. \n","Table 48: Fair Value Level 3 Summary \n","December 31, 2023 \n","December 31, 2022 \n","($ in billions) \n","Total \n","balance \n","Level 3 (1) \n","Total \n","balance \n","Level 3 (1) \n","Assets recorded at fair \n","value on a recurring \n","basis \n","$ 276.2 \n","9.5 \n","264.4 \n","11.5 \n","As a percentage \n","of total assets \n","14 % \n","* \n","14 \n","* \n","Liabilities recorded at fair \n","value on a recurring \n","basis \n","$ \n","47.7 \n","6.2 \n","41.9 \n","4.9 \n","As a percentage of \n","total liabilities \n"," 3 % \n","* \n"," 2 \n","* \n","* \n","Less than 1%. \n","(1) \n","Before derivative netting adjustments. \n","See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion on \n","our fair value of financial instruments, our related measurement \n","techniques and the impact to our financial statements. \n","Income Taxes \n","We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we \n","operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: \n","current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax \n","expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded \n","for the current period and includes income tax expense related to \n","uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the \n","more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to \n","determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax \n","position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that \n","management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of \n","realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our \n","realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \n","Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \n","method and deferred income tax expense results from changes \n","in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the \n","balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is \n","based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and \n","tax basis of assets and liabilities and recognizes enacted changes \n","in income tax rates and laws in the period in which they \n","occur. Deferred tax assets, including those related to net \n","operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, are recognized \n","subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely \n","than not. When necessary, valuation allowances are established \n","to reduce deferred tax assets to the realizable amounts. \n","The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate \n","are complex and subject to different interpretations by \n","management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In \n","establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make \n","judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax \n","laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future \n","certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax \n","jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review \n","during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise \n","over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these \n","disputes during the tax examination and audit process and \n","ultimately through the court systems when applicable. \n","We monitor relevant tax authorities and may update our \n","estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax \n","laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory \n","authorities on a quarterly basis. Updates to our estimate of \n","accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax \n","planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. \n","Such updates to our estimates may be material to our operating \n","results for any given quarter. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","61 \n","See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes \n","and related income tax assets and liabilities. \n","Liability for Legal Actions \n","The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, \n","governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or \n","investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its \n","business activities, and many of those proceedings and \n","investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss or \n","other adverse consequences. We establish accruals for legal \n","actions when potential losses associated with the actions \n","become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For \n","such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best \n","estimate within a range of potential losses that are both \n","probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best \n","estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those \n","potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may \n","be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for \n","those actions. \n","We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for \n","potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing \n","the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. \n","Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of \n","reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for \n","probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding \n","of information currently available related to the legal evaluation \n","and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on \n","these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and \n","senior management. These matters may be in various stages of \n","investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a \n","wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and \n","jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was \n","not considered or was considered remote in anticipated \n","occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will \n","change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. \n","The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject \n","to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to \n","determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also \n","inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there \n","may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably \n","possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses \n","may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of \n","reasonably possible loss. \n","See Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report for additional information. \n","Goodwill Impairment \n","We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or \n","more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors \n","warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-\n","term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue \n","generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by \n","regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in \n","market capitalization. \n","We identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill \n","impairment at the reportable operating segment level or one \n","level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as \n","allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible \n","assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-\n","sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital \n","requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units \n","based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using \n","both an income approach and a market approach which are \n","intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as \n","well as external market conditions. The methodologies for \n","calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are \n","periodically assessed by senior management and updated as \n","necessary. \n","The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) \n","analysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows \n","associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires \n","significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our \n","reporting units, which includes future expectations of economic \n","conditions and balance sheet changes, as well as considerations \n","related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed \n","by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, \n","we incorporate a terminal value estimate. We discount these \n","forecasted cash flows using a consistent rate derived from the \n","capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of \n","equity for our reporting units, reflecting risks and uncertainties in \n","the financial markets and in our internally generated business \n","projections. \n","The market approach utilizes observable market data from \n","comparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings \n","or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting \n","unit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a \n","control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical \n","acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in \n","the selection of comparable companies and includes those with \n","the most similar business activities. \n","The aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our \n","market capitalization for our fourth quarter 2023 assessment. \n","Factors that we believe contributed to this difference included an \n","overall premium that would be paid to gain control of the \n","operating and financial decisions of the Company, as well as \n","short-term market volatility and other factors that may not be \n","reflected consistently between the Company’s market \n","capitalization and the fair value of individual reporting units. \n","Based on our fourth quarter 2023 assessment, there was no \n","impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2023. The fair values of \n","each reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts by \n","substantial amounts, with the exception of our Consumer \n","Lending reporting unit. Although the fair value of our Consumer \n","Lending reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by more \n","than 10%, it was the most sensitive to changes in valuation \n","assumptions. We plan to continue the execution of our more \n","focused strategy for the home lending business in the near-term. \n","The credit card business has forecasted higher loan balances \n","driven by growth from new products and services. Significant \n","changes to these plans or forecasts or a significant increase in the \n","discount rate could result in an impairment for the Consumer \n","Lending reporting unit.

We discuss below \n","risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and \n","condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the \n","Company. \n","ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND \n","LIQUIDITY RISKS \n","Our financial results have been, and will continue to be, \n","materially affected by general economic conditions, and a \n","deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial \n","markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other \n","businesses and our financial results and condition.  We \n","generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the \n","loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial \n","amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest \n","income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and \n","commercial lending and banking businesses. These businesses \n","have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the \n","state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and \n","home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty \n","stemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, \n","including concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes, \n","and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact \n","the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including \n","international political unrest or disturbances, wars, and terrorist \n","activities, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices, \n","restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliatory \n","measures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the \n","stability of financial markets and the global economy. Any \n","impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to the \n","U.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global \n","economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions \n","and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or \n","any other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the U.S. \n","or global economy, could materially adversely affect our \n","financial results and condition. \n","A weakening in business or economic conditions, including \n","higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as \n","higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers’ \n","ability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can \n","increase our credit losses. If unemployment levels worsen or if \n","home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs \n","and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit \n","losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer \n","loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially \n","for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries \n","that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The \n","ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may \n","deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE \n","lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In \n","addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it \n","more challenging for us to increase our consumer and \n","commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy \n","borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic \n","conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest \n","rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our \n","retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on \n","our consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions worsen \n","and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a \n","decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the \n","demand for our products, including our consumer and \n","commercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest \n","income and our earnings. \n","A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which \n","may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or \n","increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely \n","affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our \n","investment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, \n","markets and investment banking businesses. For example, \n","because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of \n","assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those \n","assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market \n","prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing \n","commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage \n","business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively \n","affect the performance of products we have provided to \n","customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional \n","costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial \n","markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity \n","underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture \n","capital business and trading activities, including through \n","increased counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global \n","financial markets and economies, including as a result of any \n","geopolitical matters or unrest, may adversely affect the revenue \n","and earnings of our international operations, particularly our \n","global financial institution and correspondent banking services. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” \n","sections in this Report. \n","Changes in interest rates and financial market values could \n","reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our \n","other comprehensive income, including as a result of \n","recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we \n","hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in \n","either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning \n","assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the \n","February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net \n","interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can \n","affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our \n","assets and the funding costs of our liabilities tend to move in the \n","same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can \n","rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin \n","to expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the \n","yield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets \n","falls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin tends \n","to contract. \n","The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect \n","our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the \n","form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. \n","As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower \n","demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield \n","and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and \n","net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged \n","period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower \n","yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, \n","particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher \n","yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. A prolonged \n","period of high interest rates, however, may continue to \n","negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit \n","66 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher \n","interest payments. Similarly, a prolonged period of high interest \n","rates may increase our funding costs, including the rates we pay \n","on customer deposits. As described below, changes in interest \n","rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of \n","our MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB \n","significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate over \n","the last two years, however, the FRB could decide to further raise \n","it or lower it in 2024. \n","Changes in the slope of the yield curve – or the spread \n","between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also \n","reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. \n","Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term \n","rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve \n","flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest \n","margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding \n","increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term \n","assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which \n","interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest \n","income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the \n","interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while \n","also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with \n","the FRB. \n","We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on \n","our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on \n","assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of \n","interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may \n","hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate \n","derivatives. We also experience the somewhat offsetting effect \n","that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can \n","provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite \n","directions based on changes in interest rates. \n","We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There \n","is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or \n","option volatility could reduce our net interest income and \n","earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material \n","amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially \n","different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates \n","rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve \n","changes, we may experience significant losses, including \n","unrealized losses, on debt securities in our portfolio. To reduce \n","our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt \n","securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic \n","actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In \n","addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis \n","risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. \n","We have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as \n","commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, \n","debt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to benchmark \n","rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or \n","other financial metrics. If any such benchmark rate or other \n","referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or \n","discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market \n","benchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or \n","differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or \n","payment amount depending on the terms of the governing \n","instrument. This could impact the financial performance of \n","previously recorded transactions, result in losses on financial \n","instruments we hold, require different hedging strategies or \n","result in ineffective or increased basis risk on existing hedges, \n","impact the overall interest rate environment and the availability \n","or cost of funding transactions, affect our capital and liquidity \n","planning and management, or have other adverse financial \n","consequences. It may also result in significant operational, \n","systems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and \n","operational costs, legal or regulatory proceedings, reputational \n","harm, or other adverse consequences. Because of changing \n","economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, \n","affecting issuers and the performance of any underlying \n","collateral, we may be required to recognize impairment in future \n","periods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the \n","debt securities we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest \n","rates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income \n","also is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, \n","foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in \n","connection with our trading activities, which are conducted \n","primarily to accommodate the investment and risk management \n","activities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic \n","hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt \n","securities and equity securities held for trading are carried at fair \n","value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in \n","noninterest income. As part of our business to support our \n","customers, we trade public debt and equity securities and other \n","financial instruments that are subject to market fluctuations with \n","gains and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although \n","high market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-\n","related losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse \n","effect on our businesses as a result of reduced customer activity \n","levels. Although we have processes in place to measure and \n","monitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including \n","stress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance \n","that our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding \n","losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial \n","results. \n","The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity \n","securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable \n","equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and \n","losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are \n","carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement \n","alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized \n","gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity \n","securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may \n","have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. \n","When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of \n","factors, including general economic and market conditions, the \n","prospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company \n","goes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, \n","and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. \n","Nonmarketable equity securities include our venture capital \n","and private equity investments that could result in significant \n","impairment losses for those investments carried under the \n","measurement alternative or equity method. If we recognize an \n","impairment for an investment, we write-down the carrying value \n","of the investment to fair value, resulting in a charge to earnings, \n","which could be significant. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk,” “– Mortgage \n","Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk,” “– Market Risk – Trading \n","Activities,” and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the \n","“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\n","Maturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 2 \n","(Trading Activities), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\n","Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 4 (Equity Securities) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report. \n","Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation \n","of our business, and our financial results and condition could be \n","materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage \n","our liquidity. We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a \n","low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","67 \n","the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, \n","our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, \n","our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to \n","pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the \n","FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and \n","international money through capital markets. \n","Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business \n","could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions \n","and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and \n","volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial \n","markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial \n","crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of \n","customer deposits, outflows of cash or collateral, an inability to \n","access capital markets on favorable terms, or other adverse \n","effects on our liquidity and funding. The financial system also \n","experienced disruption and volatility in early 2023 due to the \n","failure of several banks, and episodes of disruption, volatility or \n","other adverse market conditions may continue to occur if there \n","are additional instances of actual or threatened bank failures. \n","Market disruption and volatility could also impact our credit \n","spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of \n","U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the \n","same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. \n","Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could \n","significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and \n","factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and \n","funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the \n","Company or negative news about the Company or the financial \n","services industry generally which also may result in a loss of \n","deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital \n","markets; any inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; \n","disruptions or volatility in the market for securities repurchase \n","agreements, or any inability to effectively access the market for \n","securities repurchase agreements, which also may increase our \n","short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or \n","restrictions, including changes to regulatory capital or liquidity \n","requirements; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws \n","on lines of credit; any inability to access secured borrowing \n","facilities through the FHLB or FRB, or any negative perception in \n","the market created by accessing these facilities; and, as described \n","below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of \n","the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over \n","which we have little or no control. Similarly, the speed with which \n","information is disseminated and the speed with which customers \n","can withdraw funds in response to information may also \n","contribute to a faster and greater loss of deposits, particularly \n","uninsured or non-operational deposits, as well as other adverse \n","effects on liquidity or funding, similar to what contributed to the \n","failure of several banks in early 2023. There can be no assurance \n","that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets \n","will not occur in the future. For example, concerns over \n","geopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as \n","global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility. \n","In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels, \n","including any potential failure to raise the debt limit, and any \n","associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may \n","cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the \n","sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt \n","ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as \n","well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing \n","economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely \n","affect the market value of the U.S. government securities or \n","federal agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that we hold, \n","the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and \n","our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as \n","have other material adverse effects on the operation of our \n","business and our financial results and condition. \n","As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our \n","funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial \n","services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the \n","rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either \n","because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we \n","lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of \n","funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms \n","of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive \n","other investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money \n","market mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. \n","When customers move money out of bank deposits and into \n","other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of \n","funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our \n","liquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit \n","balances in order to manage under the asset cap. \n","If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through \n","customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms, \n","if there are changes to our regulatory capital or liquidity \n","requirements, or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs \n","or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on \n","an intra-day or intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest \n","margin, and financial results and condition may be materially \n","adversely affected. As we did during the financial crisis in 2009, \n","we may also need, or be required by our regulators, to raise \n","additional capital through the issuance of common stock, which \n","could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or \n","even eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve capital or \n","to raise additional capital. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report. \n","Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material \n","adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, and financial results \n","and condition. Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding \n","are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of \n","our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow \n","funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and \n","could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise \n","collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely \n","affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit \n","ratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ \n","analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, including \n","our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the \n","level and quality of our earnings, and rating agency assumptions \n","regarding the probability and extent of federal financial \n","assistance or support. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing \n","costs are affected by various other external factors, including \n","market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial \n","services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we \n","will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit \n","ratings downgrades in the future would not have a material \n","adverse effect on our ability to borrow funds and borrowing \n","costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger \n","additional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on \n","the severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse \n","effect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related \n","contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. \n","For information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk \n","Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and \n","Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding \n","additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain \n","derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","68 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","below investment grade, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial \n","Statements in this Report. \n","We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and \n","federal and state law, regulatory requirements, and certain \n","contractual arrangements can limit those dividends.  Wells \n","Fargo & Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is \n","a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It \n","receives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from \n","dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We \n","generally use these dividends and distributions, among other \n","things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and \n","interest and principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit \n","the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and \n","some of our nonbank subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer \n","subsidiaries, may pay to the Parent. Similarly, as part of their \n","supervisory authority, regulators may limit or restrict subsidiary \n","capital distributions. In addition, as part of our resolution \n","planning efforts, we have entered into a Support Agreement \n","dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, \n","among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding \n","company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo \n","Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo \n","Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the \n","Parent designated from time to time as material entities for \n","resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as \n","related support entities in our resolution plan, pursuant to which \n","the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the \n","Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined \n","triggers or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a \n","case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also, our right to \n","participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s \n","liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the \n","subsidiary’s creditors. \n","For additional information, see the “Regulation and \n","Supervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company \n","Structure” sections in our 2023 Form 10-K and the “Regulatory \n","Matters” section and Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements \n","and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","REGULATORY RISKS \n","Current and future legislation and/or regulation could require \n","us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our \n","revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or \n","otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or \n","competitive position.  Our parent company, our subsidiary \n","banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those \n","related to our brokerage business, are subject to significant and \n","extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as \n","well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of \n","the U.S. where they conduct business. These regulations \n","generally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, \n","consumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial \n","system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. \n","Economic, market and political conditions during the past few \n","years have led to a significant amount of legislation and \n","regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services \n","industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of \n","financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws \n","and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we \n","do business and the products and services that we provide, affect \n","or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our \n","ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our \n","revenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, \n","limit subsidiary capital distributions, increase our capital or \n","liquidity requirements, impose additional fines or assessments \n","on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial \n","services industry, and adversely affect our business operations or \n","have other negative consequences. Our businesses and revenue \n","in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject to risks from political, \n","economic and social developments in those jurisdictions, \n","including sanctions or business restrictions, asset freezes or \n","confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic developments, or \n","financial or social instability. In addition, changes to tax laws, \n","regulations, and guidance may negatively impact our effective \n","income tax rate, financial results, or the amount of any tax assets \n","or liabilities. Furthermore, greater government oversight and \n","scrutiny of Wells Fargo, as well as financial services companies \n","generally, has increased our operational and compliance costs as \n","we must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing \n","our procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory \n","standards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory \n","requirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in \n","non-U.S. jurisdictions, could continue to result in significant fines, \n","penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, reputational \n","harm, or other adverse consequences. \n","Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, \n","credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending \n","businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly \n","complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as \n","enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory \n","examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB’s \n","rules and requirements may continue to increase our compliance \n","costs, limit the fees we can charge for certain products and \n","services, and require changes in our business practices, which \n","could limit or negatively affect our earnings as well as the \n","products and services that we offer our customers. If we fail to \n","meet enhanced regulatory requirements and expectations with \n","respect to our consumer businesses, we may be subject to \n","increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business \n","activities including the products and services we can provide, \n","reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. \n","In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a \n","comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter \n","derivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory \n","agencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based \n","swaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to \n","negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter \n","derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives \n","or amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for \n","engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives \n","activities. \n","We are also subject to various rules and regulations related \n","to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, \n","including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These rules and \n","regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies \n","and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery \n","and corruption, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, \n","currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. \n","Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply \n","with these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully \n","effective or do not meet regulatory standards or expectations, \n","we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain \n","business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse \n","consequences. \n","Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations \n","enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental \n","authorities relating to the privacy of the information of \n","customers, employees and others. These laws and regulations, \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","69 \n","among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a \n","significant impact on our businesses’ collection, processing, \n","sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data \n","breaches; and provide for significant penalties for non-\n","compliance. \n","In addition, we are subject to a number of consent orders \n","and other regulatory actions, including a February 2018 consent \n","order with the FRB regarding the Board’s governance and \n","oversight of the Company, and the Company’s compliance and \n","operational risk management program. This consent order limits \n","the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the \n","consent order to the level as of December 31, 2017, until certain \n","conditions are met. This limitation could continue to adversely \n","affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also \n","subject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC \n","regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program \n","and past practices involving certain automobile collateral \n","protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate \n","lock extensions. In addition, we are subject to a September 2021 \n","consent order with the OCC regarding loss mitigation activities in \n","the Company’s Home Lending business. Similarly, we are subject \n","to a December 2022 consent order with the CFPB regarding \n","multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer \n","deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. We are also subject to \n","older consent orders including dating back to 2011. Addressing \n","these and other regulatory actions is expected to take multiple \n","years, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays \n","along the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely \n","to continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and \n","control infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory \n","actions. \n","Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank \n","remains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in \n","November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain \n","non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors \n","and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain \n","regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain \n","individuals and employees. \n","The Company may be subject to further actions, including \n","the imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory \n","agreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators \n","regarding similar or other issues. Regulators have indicated the \n","potential for escalating consequences for banks that do not \n","timely resolve open issues or have repeat issues. Furthermore, \n","issues or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory \n","action could affect our progress on others. Failure to satisfy the \n","requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result \n","in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, limitations on \n","subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or liquidity \n","requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse \n","consequences, which could be significant. For example, in \n","September 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money \n","penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in \n","addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent \n","order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home \n","Lending business. Compliance with the February 2018 FRB \n","consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, the \n","September 2021 OCC consent order, the December 2022 CFPB \n","consent order, older consent orders including dating back to \n","2011, and any other consent orders or regulatory actions, as well \n","as the implementation of their requirements, may continue to \n","increase the Company’s costs, require the Company to reallocate \n","resources away from growing its existing businesses, subject the \n","Company to business restrictions, negatively impact the \n","Company’s capital and liquidity, require the Company to undergo \n","significant changes to its business, operations, products and \n","services, and risk management practices, and subject the \n","Company to other adverse consequences. For additional \n","information on the Company’s consent orders, see the \n","“Overview” section in this Report. \n","Any future legislation, rule and/or regulation also could \n","significantly change our regulatory environment, increase our \n","cost of doing business, limit the activities we may pursue, affect \n","the competitive balance among banks and other financial \n","services companies, and have a material adverse effect on our \n","financial results and condition. \n","For additional information on the significant regulations and \n","regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect \n","our business, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this Report \n","and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2023 Form \n","10-K. \n","We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or \n","liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities \n","or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or \n","recovery plan is deficient.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB \n","and the FDIC, Wells Fargo prepares and periodically submits \n","resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” designed to facilitate \n","our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial \n","distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or \n","FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution plans. \n","If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that a resolution plan has \n","deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or \n","liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or \n","operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the \n","FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable \n","to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain \n","assets or operations. \n","In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \n","periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a \n","range of options that we may consider during times of \n","idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any \n","financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without \n","extraordinary government support. The Bank must also prepare \n","and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan. If either the \n","FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, \n","they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately \n","require us to divest assets. \n","Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of \n","Wells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full. \n","If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \n","proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \n","regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly \n","liquidation authority,” which allows for the appointment of the \n","FDIC as receiver. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires \n","that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses \n","before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are \n","substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the \n","orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, \n","including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of \n","creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain \n","circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure \n","instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. \n","The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \n","a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \n","only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. \n","However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \n","binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo. \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","70 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","To facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, we \n","entered into the Support Agreement, pursuant to which the \n","Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets to the IHC \n","and will continue to transfer assets to the IHC from time to time. \n","In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC \n","will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital \n","and/or liquidity to the Bank and certain other direct and indirect \n","subsidiaries of the Parent. Under the Support Agreement, the \n","IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through \n","subordinated notes and a committed line of credit. If certain \n","liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if \n","the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under \n","the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be \n","forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the \n","IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, \n","any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s \n","liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, \n","and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy \n","proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have \n","otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not \n","implemented. \n","Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on \n","shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of the \n","Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. \n","Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive \n","significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Parent’s \n","security holders could face significant or complete losses. This \n","outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the \n","U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly \n","liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted \n","using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple point of \n","entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its \n","subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution \n","proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multiple \n","point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiaries \n","could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s \n","security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy proved \n","to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater losses \n","than if the strategy had not been implemented. \n","For additional information, see the “Regulatory Matters – \n","‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this \n","Report. \n","Regulatory rules and requirements may impose higher capital \n","and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock \n","dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our \n","business, or provide loans or other products and services to our \n","customers.  The Company and each of our insured depository \n","institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy \n","requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In \n","particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal \n","banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital \n","requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, \n","among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating \n","capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal \n","banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a \n","supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and \n","our insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized \n","rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term \n","debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and \n","resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity \n","(TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued final \n","rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable \n","funding ratio. \n","In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced \n","capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms \n","pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital \n","plan rule that establishes capital planning and other \n","requirements that govern capital distributions, including \n","dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \n","Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations \n","implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs \n","like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk \n","and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and \n","imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators \n","determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the \n","United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules \n","implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and \n","national banks. Furthermore, the FRB has established \n","expectations regarding effective boards of directors of large \n","BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has also established \n","heightened governance and risk management standards for large \n","national banks, such as the Bank. \n","The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, \n","liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may \n","limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including \n","common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require \n","us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that \n","we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or \n","liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, \n","such as from the adoption of the current proposal to revise the \n","Basel standards in the U.S., changes in regulatory interpretations \n","regarding risk-weighted asset calculation methodologies, \n","including the impact from securitizations of credit risk, or as a \n","result of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk \n","profile, could increase our funding costs, reduce our flexibility to \n","source and deploy funding, or require us to liquidate assets or \n","otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or \n","investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial \n","results. Although not currently anticipated, new capital \n","requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise \n","additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock \n","may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, \n","federal banking regulations may continue to increase our \n","compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our \n","business or provide loans or other products and services to our \n","customers. \n","For additional information, see the “Capital Management,” \n","“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk \n","and Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” \n","sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” \n","section in our 2023 Form 10-K. \n","FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can \n","significantly affect business and economic conditions and our \n","financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of \n","money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part \n","our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we \n","earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our \n","net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest \n","rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial \n","instruments we hold, such as debt securities. In addition, its \n","policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk \n","that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies, \n","including its target range for the federal funds rate or actions \n","taken to increase or decrease the size of its balance sheet, are \n","beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB \n","significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate over \n","the last two years to address high inflation, however, the FRB \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","71 \n","could decide to further raise it or lower it in 2024. As noted \n","above, changes in the interest rate environment and yield curve \n","which may result from the FRB’s actions could negatively affect \n","our net interest income and net interest margin. \n","CREDIT RISKS \n","Increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in \n","economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could \n","require us to increase our provision for credit losses and \n","allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse \n","effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n","When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit \n","risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. \n","As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance \n","of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results \n","and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading \n","and other activities. As noted above, if the economic \n","environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and \n","counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or \n","other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit \n","losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses \n","by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The \n","amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of expected \n","credit losses over the anticipated life of our loan portfolio \n","(including unfunded credit commitments). The process for \n","determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our \n","financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective, and \n","complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of \n","economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of \n","our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the \n","allowance because of changing economic conditions, including \n","falling home or commercial real estate values, higher \n","unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in \n","consumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely \n","affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory \n","environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, \n","disease pandemics such as COVID-19, political or social matters, \n","or trade policies, also can continue to influence recognition of \n","credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for \n","credit losses. \n","Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a \n","variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit \n","quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic \n","conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses \n","was appropriate at December 31, 2023, there is no assurance \n","that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event \n","of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we \n","experience significant loan growth, we may be required to \n","increase the allowance in future periods, which would reduce our \n","earnings. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – \n","Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. \n","We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the \n","extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry \n","segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or \n","collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our \n","loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or \n","similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group \n","may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or \n","market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market \n","conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or \n","geography may also impact related or dependent industries or \n","the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in \n","such industries to meet their financial obligations. We \n","experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 \n","when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential \n","real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater \n","than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in \n","many markets, including the Central Valley California market and \n","several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As \n","California is our largest banking state in terms of loans, \n","deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic \n","conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could \n","result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in \n","consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely \n","affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may \n","increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these \n","borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration \n","in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could \n","result in materially higher credit losses, including for our \n","residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes \n","nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. \n","We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as \n","our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their \n","contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize. \n","We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. \n","A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects \n","the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including \n","increases in interest rates and related refinancing risks at \n","maturity, declines in commercial property values, and/or changes \n","in consumer behavior or other market conditions, such as a \n","continued decrease in the demand for office space, could result in \n","materially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect \n","on our financial results and condition. \n","Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions \n","may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in \n","non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material \n","adverse effect on our credit performance and results of \n","operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively \n","affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. \n","operations. \n","Due to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain \n","derivative transactions through central counterparty \n","clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to these \n","CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we \n","may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the \n","CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults \n","on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of non-\n","performance by our clients for which we clear transactions \n","through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not \n","sufficiently covered by available collateral. \n","For additional information regarding credit risk, see the \n","“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section and \n","Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report. \n","OPERATIONAL, STRATEGIC, AND LEGAL RISKS \n","A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, \n","controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors \n","and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, \n","damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  As \n","a large financial institution that serves customers through \n","numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking \n","and other distribution channels across the U.S. and \n","internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and \n","monitor a large number of customer transactions on a \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","72 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have a \n","broad geographic footprint throughout the U.S. and \n","internationally, as we have increasingly used the internet and \n","mobile banking to provide products and services to our \n","customers, as customer, public, legislative and regulatory \n","expectations regarding operational and information security \n","have increased, and as cyber and other information security \n","attacks have become more prevalent and complex, our \n","operational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue \n","to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, \n","disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, \n","data processing systems or other operating systems and \n","facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based \n","on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged \n","as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly \n","or partially beyond our control. For example, there have been and \n","could in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction \n","volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation \n","or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural \n","disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease \n","pandemics such as COVID-19; events arising from local or larger \n","scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as \n","described below, cyber attacks or other information security \n","incidents. The COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could \n","result in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on \n","us or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already \n","experienced, including creating additional operational and \n","compliance risks, such as the need to comply with rapidly \n","changing regulatory requirements and to quickly implement new \n","measures to protect the functionality of our systems, networks, \n","and operations. \n","Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our \n","infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, \n","entail significant costs, and create risks associated with \n","implementing new systems and integrating them with existing \n","ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our \n","systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and \n","operating systems, including their security measures and \n","controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and \n","security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover \n","critical business processes or operations that have been \n","disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and \n","consequences of such disruptions. Although we have enterprise \n","incident response processes, business continuity plans and other \n","safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our \n","business operations may be adversely affected by significant and \n","widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating \n","systems that support our businesses and customers. For \n","example, we have experienced system issues caused by a variety \n","of factors that have resulted in intermittent service \n","interruptions, such as temporary disruptions to online and mobile \n","banking services, delays in posting transactions, and customer \n","difficulty signing into accounts. \n","As a result of financial institutions and technology systems \n","becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational \n","incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material \n","impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, \n","third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our \n","business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as \n","exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors \n","that provide services or security solutions for our operations, \n","could continue to be sources of operational risk to us, including \n","from information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or \n","failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies \n","in the performance of their responsibilities. These risks are \n","increased to the extent we rely on a single third party or on third \n","parties in a single geographic area. We are also exposed to the \n","risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common \n","service provider to our third parties could impede their ability to \n","provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In \n","addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and \n","expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, \n","and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their \n","obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, \n","regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, \n","restrictions on our business, or other adverse consequences. \n","Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls \n","or operating systems that support our businesses and \n","customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to \n","adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform \n","their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or \n","oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business \n","disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, remediation and other costs, violations of \n","applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, customer \n","harm, or other adverse consequences, any of which could \n","materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial \n","condition. \n","A cyber attack or other information security incident could \n","have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \n","financial condition, or reputation.  Information security risks for \n","large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally \n","increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of \n","new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and \n","cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the \n","increased prevalence and availability of artificial intelligence, the \n","increase in remote work arrangements, and the increased \n","sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, \n","terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign \n","state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to \n","attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to \n","commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or \n","attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other \n","users of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or \n","other information to gain access to our data or that of our \n","customers. Geopolitical matters may also elevate the risk of an \n","information security threat, particularly by foreign state-\n","sponsored parties or their supporters. As noted above, our \n","operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and \n","storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our \n","computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, \n","investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our \n","digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, \n","hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, \n","to access our products and services, our customers may use \n","personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are \n","beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, \n","software, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be \n","the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, \n","which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of \n","fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, \n","monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our \n","customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or \n","the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third \n","parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have \n","reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large \n","amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card \n","information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur \n","costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","73 \n","transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed \n","to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of \n","the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and \n","procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security \n","controls for personal gain or other improper purposes. \n","Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of \n","financial institutions and technology systems, an information \n","security incident at a third party or a third party’s downstream \n","service providers may increase the risk of loss or material impact \n","to us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties \n","(including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, \n","including those that facilitate our business activities or to which \n","we outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology, \n","hardware, software, and cloud service providers, continue to be \n","sources of information security risk to us. We could suffer \n","material harm, including business disruptions, losses or \n","remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, or other adverse consequences as a result of the \n","failure of those third parties to adequately or appropriately \n","safeguard their technologies, systems, networks, hardware, and \n","software, or as a result of our or our customers’ data being \n","compromised due to information security incidents affecting \n","those third parties. \n","Our risk and exposure to information security threats \n","remains heightened because of, among other things, the \n","persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent \n","size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services \n","industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and \n","mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote \n","connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how \n","they want to be served, our geographic footprint and \n","international presence, our use of third parties, the outsourcing \n","of some of our business operations, and the current global \n","economic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo \n","and other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service \n","providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and \n","adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, \n","malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to \n","exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential \n","validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to \n","disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their \n","cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, \n","proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also \n","focused on targeting online applications and services, such as \n","online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and \n","services provided by third parties, and have targeted the \n","infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread \n","unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As \n","a result, information security and the continued development \n","and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems \n","designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data \n","from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for \n","Wells Fargo. We are also involved in industry cybersecurity \n","efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party \n","service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to \n","enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security \n","threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to \n","continue to be required to expend significant resources to \n","develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate \n","and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or \n","incidents. Because the investigation of any information security \n","breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to \n","complete, we may not be able to immediately address the \n","consequences of a breach, which may further increase any \n","associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our \n","insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such \n","insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses \n","associated with an information security breach. \n","Cyber attacks or other information security incidents \n","affecting us or third parties (including their downstream service \n","providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our \n","business activities or to which we outsource operations, or \n","affecting the networks, systems or devices that our customers \n","use to access our products and services, could result in business \n","disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations \n","of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or \n","other adverse consequences, any of which could materially \n","adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \n","Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in \n","mitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework \n","seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established \n","processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, \n","monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are \n","subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest \n","rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and \n","reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk \n","management framework, there are inherent limitations to our \n","risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the \n","future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, \n","identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also \n","dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and an \n","appropriate risk mindset exist throughout the Company. The \n","inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the \n","appropriate culture throughout the Company, including the \n","inability to align performance management and compensation to \n","achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the \n","effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we \n","are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we \n","may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We \n","process a large number of transactions each day and could \n","continue to experience increased costs, regulatory investigations, \n","or other adverse consequences if we do not accurately or \n","completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to \n","human error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent \n","fraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service \n","provider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, \n","inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other \n","misconduct. \n","In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor \n","and predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and \n","credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, \n","there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or \n","sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future \n","events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are \n","subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to \n","meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, \n","penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, or other \n","adverse consequences, and any required modifications or \n","changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and \n","requirements and result in increased operational and compliance \n","costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our \n","various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with \n","the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our \n","aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could \n","result in ineffective risk management practices, business \n","decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or \n","inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","74 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or \n","automate certain business decisions, operations, and risk \n","management practices, as well as to improve our customer \n","service, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will \n","appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human \n","assessment or accurately predict future events or exposures. For \n","example, the algorithms or datasets underlying our artificial \n","intelligence may be inaccurate or include other weaknesses that \n","could result in deficient or biased data outputs or other \n","unintended consequences. Accordingly, even though we may \n","have controls, our use of artificial intelligence could result in \n","ineffective business decisions, operations, risk management \n","practices, or customer service, legal or regulatory proceedings, \n","reputational harm, or other adverse effects on our business or \n","financial results. \n","Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory \n","reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the \n","limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators \n","remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells \n","Fargo in particular, maintain risk management policies and \n","practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, \n","we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially \n","adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \n","We may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to \n","instances where customers may have experienced financial \n","harm.  We have identified and may in the future identify areas or \n","instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, \n","including as a result of our continuing efforts to strengthen our \n","risk and control infrastructure. For example, we identified certain \n","issues related to past practices involving certain automobile \n","collateral protection insurance policies and certain issues related \n","to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection \n","waiver or insurance agreements. We also previously entered into \n","settlements to resolve inquiries or investigations by various \n","government entities and lawsuits by non-government parties \n","arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company. \n","Negative publicity or public opinion resulting from instances \n","where customers may have experienced financial harm may \n","continue to increase the risk of reputational harm to our \n","business. Similarly, the identification of areas or instances where \n","customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, \n","and in some cases has already resulted in, significant remediation \n","costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \n","proceedings, compliance and other costs, or other adverse \n","consequences. \n","For additional information, see the “Overview – Retail Sales \n","Practices Matters” and “Overview – Customer Remediation \n","Activities” sections in this Report. \n","We may incur fines, penalties, business restrictions, and other \n","adverse consequences from regulatory violations or from any \n","failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations.  We \n","maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we \n","comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are \n","subject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and \n","expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly \n","complex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject \n","to consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to \n","various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or \n","issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations \n","and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in \n","the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental \n","entities in different jurisdictions. Also, the laws and regulations in \n","jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even \n","conflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal \n","and state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to \n","the products and services we may offer or other business \n","activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance \n","difficulties or issues. Additionally, regulatory or compliance issues \n","at other financial institutions could result in regulatory scrutiny \n","for us. We could also be subject to regulatory actions, including \n","fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse \n","consequences, if we fail to obtain applicable licensing or \n","registration in any jurisdiction in which we offer our products and \n","services. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require \n","us to report transactions and other information to regulators and \n","other governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, \n","exchanges, clearing houses and customers. We may be subject to \n","fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse \n","consequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately \n","provide regulatory reports, customer notices, or disclosures. \n","Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for \n","the imposition of fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other \n","adverse consequences for noncompliance even though the \n","noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even \n","though there were systems and procedures in place at the time \n","designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to \n","regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control \n","(OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in \n","the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain \n","non-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. \n","OFAC may impose fines, penalties, or restrictions on certain \n","business activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations \n","even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the \n","violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or \n","regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or \n","any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, \n","including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent \n","orders or other regulatory actions, could result in significant \n","fines, penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, \n","negative impacts to our capital and liquidity, requirements to \n","undergo significant changes to our business, operations, \n","products and services, and risk management practices, \n","reputational harm, loss of customers, or other adverse \n","consequences. Furthermore, these consequences may escalate \n","to the extent issues are not timely resolved or are repeated. \n","Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged \n","conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry \n","generally, could adversely affect our business, results of \n","operations, and financial condition.  Reputation risk, or the risk \n","to our business, earnings and capital from negative public \n","opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased \n","substantially because of our size and profile in the financial \n","services industry, sales practices related matters, and instances \n","where customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative \n","public opinion about the financial services industry generally or \n","Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and \n","our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion \n","could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of \n","activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other \n","consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing \n","activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client \n","accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business \n","relationships; identification and management of potential \n","conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests \n","with and among our customers; environmental, social and \n","governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","75 \n","incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or \n","inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, \n","and from actions taken by government regulators and \n","community or other organizations in response to that conduct. \n","Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to \n","detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party \n","service providers that could potentially harm customers or our \n","reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and \n","procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. \n","Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or \n","prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our \n","business or operations could result in significant reputational \n","harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses \n","under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one \n","business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, \n","actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain \n","members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect \n","our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized \n","by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use \n","of social media by our employees and others, including personal \n","blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that \n","negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be \n","posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or \n","have other negative consequences, including as a result of our \n","employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized \n","manner in various social media outlets. \n","Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been \n","targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, \n","which have included disrupting the operation of our retail \n","banking locations, and have been subject to negative public \n","commentary, including with respect to certain business practices \n","and the fees charged for various products and services. Wells \n","Fargo and other financial institutions have also been subject to \n","negative publicity as a result of providing or reducing financial \n","services to or making investments in industries or organizations \n","subject to stakeholder concerns. There can be no assurance that \n","continued protests or negative public opinion of the Company \n","specifically or large financial institutions generally will not harm \n","our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of \n","operations, and financial condition. \n","If we are unable to develop and execute effective business \n","plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our \n","competitive standing and results of operations could suffer.  In \n","order to advance our business goals, we may undertake business \n","plans or strategies related to, among other things, our \n","organizational structure, our compliance and risk management \n","framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products \n","and services we offer, the types of businesses we engage in, the \n","geographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve \n","our clients and customers, the third parties with which we do \n","business, and the methods and distribution channels by which we \n","offer our products and services. Accomplishing these business \n","plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require \n","significant financial, technological, management and other \n","resources, may divert management attention and resources away \n","from other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses \n","and ability to generate revenue. There is no guarantee that any \n","business plans or strategies, including our current efficiency \n","initiatives, will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are \n","unable to develop or execute effective business plans or \n","strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive \n","position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of \n","operations may be adversely affected. \n","In addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest \n","certain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture \n","may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other \n","benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than \n","expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain \n","customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses \n","or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other \n","long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets, which \n","could adversely affect our financial results. \n","Similarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our \n","products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of \n","companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We \n","generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we \n","can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other \n","financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or \n","on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals \n","will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches \n","and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a \n","condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. \n","When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall \n","depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to \n","be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to \n","existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue \n","common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, \n","difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may \n","cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, \n","increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected \n","benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in \n","higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an \n","increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our \n","business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability \n","to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated \n","benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on \n","integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing \n","businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the \n","acquired company or business operates internationally or in a \n","geographic location where we do not already have significant \n","business operations and/or employees. \n","Our operations and business could be adversely affected by the \n","impacts of climate change.  The physical effects of climate \n","change, including the increased prevalence and severity of \n","extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as \n","hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere \n","with our operations or those of our third-party service providers, \n","which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause \n","losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively \n","affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the \n","credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the \n","deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, \n","changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on \n","account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a \n","low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain \n","industries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit \n","risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products \n","and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon \n","economy could affect our business practices or result in \n","additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business \n","operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with \n","climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and \n","expectations related to climate change and its impacts, could \n","require us to change certain of our business and/or risk \n","management practices, impose additional costs on us, reduce our \n","revenue or business opportunities, subject us to legal or \n","regulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our \n","Risk Factors (continued) \n","76 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","operations and business. Additionally, climate-related data may \n","be based on emerging practices that are subject to measurement \n","uncertainties or may be available only from third-parties, which \n","can impact the quality and consistency of the data and make it \n","difficult to collect, validate, and analyze, impact the effectiveness \n","of our related models, projections, strategies, and decisions, or \n","result in legal actions or other adverse consequences. Moreover, \n","our reputation may be damaged and we may lose business \n","opportunities as a result of our response to climate change or our \n","strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if \n","we are unable or perceived to be unable to achieve our objectives \n","or if our response is disliked or perceived to be ineffective or \n","insufficient. Similarly, any overstatement or mislabeling of the \n","environmental benefits of our products, services or activities may \n","subject us to legal actions, reputational harm, or other adverse \n","consequences. For additional information on regulatory \n","developments in response to climate change, see the \n","“Regulatory Matters” section in this Report. \n","We are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse \n","consequences from legal actions.  Wells Fargo and some of its \n","subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, \n","arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning \n","matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and \n","many of those proceedings and investigations expose \n","Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse \n","consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate \n","outcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for \n","legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions \n","become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We \n","may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not \n","established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a \n","legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts \n","accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal \n","action, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could \n","materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial \n","condition. \n","As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory \n","oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory \n","investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition \n","to imposing potentially significant fines, penalties, business \n","restrictions, and other adverse consequences, regulatory \n","authorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of \n","wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection \n","with settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, \n","loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital \n","markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to \n","engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or \n","services, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. \n","For additional information, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to \n","Financial Statements in this Report. \n","MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS \n","Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to \n","quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, \n","and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to \n","reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new \n","mortgage loans.  We earn revenue from fees we receive for \n","originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. \n","Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair \n","value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage \n","loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from \n","loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our \n","MSRs usually tends to increase due to a decline in the likelihood \n","of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. \n","When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase \n","and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with \n","some offsetting revenue effect. Even though changes in interest \n","rates can cause this offsetting effect, the effect is not perfect, \n","either in amount or timing. \n","We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge \n","our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of \n","our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. \n","Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant \n","losses from our hedging activities. \n","We rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet \n","their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring \n","agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and \n","the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee \n","loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or \n","government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their \n","purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, \n","and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We \n","cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will \n","not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of \n","conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a \n","conforming loan. Similarly, there have been various proposals to \n","reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role \n","of the GSEs, which, depending on any ultimate reforms enacted, \n","could have an adverse impact on our mortgage banking business. \n","In addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that \n","do not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring \n","agencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance \n","sheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be \n","used to originate new loans. \n","For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \n","Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate \n","and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of \n","Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical \n","Accounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” \n","sections in this Report. \n","We may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse \n","consequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect \n","to the residential mortgage loans or other assets we originate \n","or service.  For residential mortgage loans that we originate, we \n","could become subject to monetary damages and other civil \n","penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or \n","the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as \n","foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the \n","loans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or \n","regulations. \n","Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we \n","originate and sell, we may be required to repurchase the loans or \n","indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or \n","insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach \n","of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements \n","under which we sell the loans or in the insurance or guaranty \n","agreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. If economic \n","conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have \n","increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on \n","repurchases. We may also have repurchase or other obligations \n","to the extent we originate and securitize other assets, such as \n","credit card loans. \n","Furthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for \n","the mortgage loans we service, we may be terminated as servicer \n","or master servicer, required to indemnify the securitization \n","trustee against losses, and/or contractually obligated to \n","repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","77 \n","losses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing \n","income. \n","We may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers and/or \n","securitization investors, legal actions, or other adverse \n","consequences if we fail to meet our servicing obligations, \n","including our obligations with respect to mortgage foreclosure \n","actions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our \n","mortgage banking revenue may be negatively affected to the \n","extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure \n","or other servicing related costs. In addition, we may continue to \n","be subject to fines, penalties, business restrictions, reputational \n","harm, and other adverse consequences as a result of actual or \n","perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, \n","including with respect to our compliance with existing consent \n","order requirements, our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation \n","activities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our \n","servicing of flood zone properties. We may also face risks, \n","including regulatory, compliance, and market risks, as we pursue \n","our previously announced plans to reduce the amount of \n","residential mortgage loans we service. \n","For additional information, see the “Overview,” “Risk \n","Management – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking \n","Activities,” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of \n","Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” sections and \n","Note 13 (Legal Actions) and Note 17 (Guarantees and Other \n","Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \n","COMPETITIVE RISKS \n","We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly \n","evolving financial services industry. We compete with other \n","financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is \n","undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory \n","reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and \n","economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other \n","things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring \n","relationships with our customers based on the quality of our \n","customer service, the wide variety of products and services that \n","we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and \n","services to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the \n","pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution \n","channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our \n","reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all \n","of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, \n","market share and results of operations and/or cause us to \n","increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to \n","remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or \n","reprice our products and services from time to time may be \n","limited and could be influenced significantly by the economic, \n","regulatory and political environment for large financial \n","institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. \n","Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services \n","that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those \n","products and services could result in a loss of customer \n","relationships and market share and could materially adversely \n","affect our results of operations. \n","Continued technological advances and the growth of \n","e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository \n","institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were \n","banking products, and for financial institutions and other \n","companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial \n","solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and \n","payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including \n","digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may \n","diminish the importance of depository institutions and other \n","financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. \n","We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive \n","threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to \n","offer products and services at lower prices, increase our \n","investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing \n","products and services, and/or develop new products and services \n","to respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To the \n","extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new \n","products and services or responding or adapting to the \n","competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we \n","may lose customer relationships and our growth prospects and \n","results of operations may be materially adversely affected. \n","Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical \n","to the success of our business and failure to do so could \n","adversely affect our business performance, competitive \n","position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is \n","heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, \n","including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, \n","including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, \n","capital markets, risk management, and technology, the \n","competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also \n","seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of \n","succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract \n","and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide \n","competitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, \n","effectively manage employee performance and development, \n","and foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large \n","financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain \n","subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on \n","compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our \n","ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially \n","if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same \n","compensation limitations. Similarly, union organizing activity, \n","some of which has been successful, could continue to increase \n","our operational complexity and costs. In addition, our response to \n","this activity could be perceived negatively and harm our \n","reputation and business, subject us to legal actions, or adversely \n","affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we \n","are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, \n","including successors for senior leadership positions, our business \n","performance, competitive position and future prospects may be \n","adversely affected. \n","FINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS \n","Changes in accounting standards, and changes in how \n","accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could \n","materially affect our financial results and condition.  From time \n","to time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting \n","and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our \n","external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard \n","setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such \n","as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their \n","previous interpretations or positions on how these standards \n","should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting \n","standards and changes in current interpretations are typically \n","beyond our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially \n","affect our financial results and condition, including requiring a \n","retrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. \n","Similarly, any change in our accounting policies could also \n","materially affect our financial statements.

Several of our \n","accounting policies are critical because they require management \n","to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about \n","matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that \n","materially different amounts would be reported under different \n","conditions or using different assumptions. If the assumptions, \n","judgments, or estimates underlying our financial results are \n","incorrect or different from actual results, we could experience \n","unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could \n","be significant. For a description of our critical accounting policies, \n","see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. \n","The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires \n","our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls \n","and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting \n","and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control \n","over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual \n","report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” \n","in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not \n","identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any \n","given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our \n","reputation or stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. \n","We could also be required to devote significant resources to \n","remediate any material weakness. In addition, our customers may \n","rely on the effectiveness of certain of our operational and \n","internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those \n","controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation \n","or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit \n","services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to \n","preserve their independence from us.

We provide banking, investment and mortgage \n","products and services, as well as consumer and commercial \n","finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and \n","other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and \n","institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in \n","countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the \n","Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company \n","and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the \n","Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \n","company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \n","investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock \n","outstanding. \n","Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \n","generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \n","the financial services industry. To prepare the financial \n","statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make \n","estimates based on assumptions about future economic and \n","market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, \n","real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of \n","assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, \n","income and expenses during the reporting period and the related \n","disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current \n","conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is \n","reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than \n","anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our \n","results of operations and financial condition. Management has \n","made significant estimates in several areas, including: \n","• \n","allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related \n","Allowance for Credit Losses and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale \n","and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities)); \n","• \n","valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \n","(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 16 \n","(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \n","• \n","valuations of financial instruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of \n","Assets and Liabilities)); \n","• \n","liability for legal actions (Note 13 (Legal Actions)); \n","• \n","income taxes; and \n","• \n","goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other \n","Assets)). \n","Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n","Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023 \n","In 2023, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \n","• \n","Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial \n","Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt \n","Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures \n","• \n","ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair \n","Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method \n","• \n","ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \n","Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from \n","Contracts with Customers \n","• \n","ASU 2018-12, Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): \n","Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration \n","Contracts and subsequent related updates \n","ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and reporting for \n","troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces \n","new required disclosures for loan modifications made to \n","borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required \n","disclosures include information about modifications granted to \n","borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \n","forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \n","payment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these \n","modifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \n","financial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \n","in the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \n","amends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \n","of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \n","Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) for \n","additional information related to the new disclosures for loan \n","modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \n","for gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \n","on a prospective basis. \n","The Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \n","cash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \n","losses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \n","expected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \n","expected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications \n","and the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \n","defaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \n","expected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \n","2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \n","credit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \n","loans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \n","concession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \n","apply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, \n","resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \n","upon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\n","modification and post-modification effective interest rates that \n","would have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \n","as interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \n","our ACL of $429 million, pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \n","earnings of $323 million, after tax. We continue to use a DCF \n","approach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \n","commercial loans. \n","ASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method, which \n","expands an entity’s ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting \n","for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial \n","assets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \n","hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. \n","We adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023, on a \n","prospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the \n","opening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon \n","adoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \n","portfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \n","hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \n","financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \n","securities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger \n","proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \n","of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \n","increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \n","prepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \n","hedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \n","carrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \n","related to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at \n","a portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \n","portfolio. \n","Upon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \n","method hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update \n","88 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-\n","to-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities \n","are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 \n","days after the adoption date. \n","In January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities \n","with an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost \n","of $23.9 billion from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate \n","swaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges \n","using the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities \n","was recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately \n","$566 million of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt \n","securities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of \n","deferred taxes. \n","See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \n","Securities) for additional information about the Company’s \n","portfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \n","transfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 14 \n","(Derivatives) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \n","hedging relationships. \n","ASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) \n","805 – Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \n","measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \n","combination in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue Recognition. \n","Prior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \n","recognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \n","items at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \n","prospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a \n","material impact to our consolidated financial statements. \n","ASU 2018-12 changes the accounting for long-duration \n","insurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \n","the policyholder in addition to the policyholder’s account value. \n","These features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \n","protect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \n","risk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU \n","requires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \n","through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \n","own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \n","reinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \n","insurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are \n","accounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \n","reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. \n","We utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \n","risk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \n","because they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \n","The fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \n","in fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \n","behavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \n","mortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use \n","derivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \n","the interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \n","market risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \n","recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \n","recognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \n","excluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \n","noninterest income along with the changes in fair value of \n","economic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \n","credit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \n","adoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \n","implemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \n","retrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \n","in an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \n","earnings and increase accumulated other comprehensive income \n","by $738 million and $20 million, respectively, as of January 1, \n","2021. \n","The ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \n","assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \n","for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \n","amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting \n","changes for the liability of future policyholder benefits for \n","traditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses \n","and other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in \n","other assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption. \n","Table 1.1 presents the impact of adoption to prior period \n","financial statement line items within our consolidated statement \n","of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and \n","December 31, 2021, and the consolidated balance sheet as of \n","December 31, 2022.

Our variable \n","interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary \n","interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair \n","value of the entity’s net assets. We consolidate a VIE if we are the \n","primary beneficiary, which is when we have both the power to \n","direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a \n","variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \n","To determine whether or not a variable interest we hold could \n","potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider both qualitative \n","and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of \n","our involvement with the VIE. We assess whether or not we are \n","the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. \n"," Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are \n","eliminated in consolidation. When we have significant influence \n","over operating and financing decisions for a company but do not \n","own a majority of the voting equity interests, we account for the \n","investment using the equity method of accounting, which \n","requires us to recognize our proportionate share of the \n","company’s earnings. If we do not have significant influence, we \n","account for the equity security under the fair value method, cost \n","method or measurement alternative. \n","Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of net \n","income and equity attributable to third-party owners of \n","consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned by \n","Wells Fargo. Substantially all of our noncontrolling interests \n","relate to our affiliated venture capital businesses. \n","Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash \n","Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in cash \n","and due from banks and interest-earning deposits from banks on \n","our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are recorded at \n","amortized cost and include cash on hand, cash items in transit, \n","and amounts due from or held with other depository institutions. \n","See Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other \n","Restrictions) for additional information on the restrictions on \n","cash and cash equivalents. \n","Trading Activities \n","We engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment \n","and risk management activities of our customers. These \n","activities predominantly occur in our Corporate and Investment \n","Banking reportable operating segment. Trading assets and \n","liabilities include debt securities, equity securities, loans held for \n","sale, derivatives, and short sales, which are reported within our \n","consolidated balance sheet based on the accounting \n","classification of the instrument. In addition, certain instruments \n","that we have elected to account for under the fair value method, \n","such as debt securities that are held for investment purposes and \n","structured debt liabilities, are classified as trading. \n","Our trading assets and liabilities are carried on our \n","consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value \n","recognized in net gains from trading and securities within \n","noninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are \n","recognized in net interest income. \n","Customer accommodation trading activities include our \n","actions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments \n","and market-making activities. We also take positions to manage \n","our exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold \n","financial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short \n","positions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary, \n","we interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the \n","purchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the \n","anticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we \n","may purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to \n","manage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an \n","offsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure \n","to the customer transaction. We earn income based on the \n","transaction price difference between the customer transaction \n","and the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where \n","the fair value changes and related interest income and expense of \n","the positions are recorded. \n","Our market-making activities include taking long and short \n","trading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These \n","activities are typically executed on a short-term basis. As a \n","market-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference \n","between the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of \n","the security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the \n","positions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading \n","positions held on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we \n","may enter into separate derivative or security positions to \n","manage our exposure related to our long and short trading \n","positions taken in our market-making activities. Income earned \n","on these market-making activities are reflected in earnings \n","where the fair value changes and related interest income and \n","expense of the positions are recorded. \n","Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","90 \n","(continued) \n","Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities \n","Our investments in debt securities that are not held for trading \n","purposes are classified as either available-for-sale (AFS) or held-\n","to-maturity (HTM). \n","Investments in debt securities not held for trading purposes, \n","for which the Company does not have the positive intent and \n","ability to hold to maturity, are classified as AFS. AFS debt \n","securities are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and \n","losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income \n","(AOCI). The amount reported in other comprehensive income \n","(OCI) is net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and \n","applicable income taxes. Investments in debt securities for which \n","the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to \n","maturity are classified as HTM. HTM debt securities are \n","measured at amortized cost, net of ACL. See Note 3 (Available-\n","for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) for additional \n","information. \n","INTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION Unamortized \n","premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over \n","the contractual life of the security using the effective interest \n","method, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a \n","premium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a \n","premium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the \n","next call date using the effective interest method. As principal \n","repayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed \n","securities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related \n","premium or discount is recognized in income such that the \n","effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security \n","continues unchanged. \n","We recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt \n","securities in net gains from trading and securities within \n","noninterest income using the specific identification method. \n","IMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses on AFS debt \n","securities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in \n","interest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of \n","debt securities, and prepayment rates which impact MBS and \n","collateralized loan obligations (CLO). Additional considerations \n","for certain types of AFS debt securities include: \n","• \n","Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, \n","including federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit \n","movements given the explicit or implicit guarantees \n","provided by the U.S. government. \n","• \n","Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are \n","most impacted by changes in the relationship between \n","municipal and term funding credit curves rather than by \n","changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities. \n","• \n","Structured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also \n","impacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets \n","underlying the security. \n","For AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \n","amortized cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we \n","have the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not \n","that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its \n","amortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized in net gains on \n","trading and securities within noninterest income equal to the \n","difference between the amortized cost basis, net of ACL, and the \n","fair value of the AFS debt security. Following the recognition of \n","this impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost \n","basis is fair value. \n","For AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \n","amortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in \n","earnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the \n","extent unrealized loss is due to credit losses. See the “Allowance \n","for Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies \n","relating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt \n","securities classified as HTM. \n","TRANSFERS BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES  Transfers \n","of debt securities from the AFS to HTM classification are \n","recorded at fair value, and accordingly the amortized cost of the \n","security transferred to HTM is adjusted to fair value. Unrealized \n","gains or losses reported in AOCI at the transfer date are \n","amortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortized \n","premiums and discounts using the effective interest method. \n","Any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model \n","is reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re-\n","established. The reversal and re-establishment of the ACL are \n","recorded in provision for credit losses. \n","Transfers of debt securities from the HTM to AFS \n","classification are recorded at fair value. The HTM amortized cost \n","(excluding any ACL previously recorded under the HTM debt \n","security model) becomes the AFS amortized cost, and the debt \n","security is remeasured at fair value with the unrealized gains and \n","losses reported in OCI. Any ACL previously recorded under the \n","HTM debt security model is reversed and an ACL under the AFS \n","debt security model is re-established. The reversal and re-\n","establishment of the ACL are recorded in provision expense. \n","Transfers from HTM to AFS are only expected to occur under \n","limited circumstances. \n","NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES We \n","generally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors \n","similar to those described for loans. When we place a debt \n","security on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid \n","interest receivable against interest income and suspend the \n","amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. If the \n","ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual \n","debt security, any cash collected is first applied to reduce the \n","security’s amortized cost basis to zero, followed by recovery of \n","amounts previously charged off, and subsequently to interest \n","income. Generally, we return a debt security to accrual status \n","when all delinquent interest and principal become current under \n","the contractual terms of the security and collectability of \n","remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. \n","Our debt securities are considered past due when \n","contractually required principal or interest payments have not \n","been made on the due dates. \n","Our charge-off policy for debt securities is similar to our \n","charge-off policy for loans. Subsequent to charge-off, the debt \n","security will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process \n","described above for any cash received. \n","Securities and Other Collateralized Financing \n","Agreements \n","Resale and repurchase agreements, as well as securities \n","borrowing and lending agreements, are accounted for as \n","collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the \n","acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. We monitor the \n","fair value of securities or other assets purchased and sold as well \n","as the collateral pledged and received. Additional collateral is \n","pledged or returned to maintain the appropriate collateral \n","position for the transactions. These financing transactions do not \n","create material credit risk given the collateral provided and the \n","related monitoring process. \n","We include securities purchased under securities financing \n","agreements in federal funds sold and securities purchased under \n","resale agreements on our consolidated balance sheet. We include \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","91 \n","collateral other than securities purchased under resale \n","agreements in loans on our consolidated balance sheet. We \n","include securities sold under securities financing agreements in \n","short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. At \n","December 31, 2023 and 2022, short-term borrowings were \n","primarily federal funds purchased and securities sold under \n","agreements to repurchase. \n","Assets and liabilities arising from securities and other \n","collateralized financing transactions with a single counterparty \n","are presented net on the balance sheet provided they meet \n","certain criteria that permit balance sheet netting. See Note 18 \n","(Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities) for \n","additional information on our offsetting policy. \n","Loans Held for Sale \n","Loans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes originated or \n","purchased commercial and residential mortgage loans for sale in \n","the securitization or whole loan market. Residential mortgage \n","LHFS are accounted for at either fair value or the lower of cost or \n","fair value (LOCOM) and may be measured on an individual or pool \n","level basis. Commercial LHFS are generally measured at LOCOM, \n","except for certain commercial LHFS in our trading business that \n","are used in market-making activities where we have elected the \n","fair value option. Commercial LHFS are generally measured on an \n","individual basis. See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \n","Liabilities) for additional information regarding LHFS fair value \n","measurements.  \n","Gains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage \n","LHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest \n","income. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net \n","gains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are \n","recognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination \n","costs and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are \n","recognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at \n","LOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at \n","origination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale. \n","Interest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate \n","of the loan and is recorded in interest income. \n","Interest rate lock commitments to originate mortgage LHFS \n","are accounted for as derivatives and are measured at fair value. \n","When a determination is made at the time of commitment to \n","originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold \n","these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to \n","periodic review under our management evaluation processes, \n","including corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent \n","changes occur, including changes in interest rates, our business \n","strategy, or other market conditions, we may change our intent \n","to hold these loans. When management makes this \n","determination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS \n","portfolio at LOCOM. \n","Loans \n","Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of \n","any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized \n","deferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized \n","premiums or discounts on purchased loans. \n","Unearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts \n","and premiums are amortized to interest income generally over \n","the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest \n","method. Loan commitment fees collected at closing are deferred \n","and amortized to noninterest income on a straight-line basis \n","over the commitment period if loan funding is unlikely. Upon \n","funding, deferred loan commitment fees are amortized to \n","interest income over the contractual life of the loan. \n","Loans also include financing leases where we are the lessor \n","(see the “Leasing Activity” section in this Note for our accounting \n","policy for leases) and resale agreements involving collateral other \n","than securities (see “Securities and Other Collateralized \n","Financing Agreements” section in this Note for our accounting \n","policy for other collateralized financing agreements). \n","See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \n","for additional information regarding our accounting for loans. \n","NONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS  We generally place loans on \n","nonaccrual status when: \n","• \n","the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes \n","uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the \n","borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, \n","if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; \n","• \n","they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential \n","mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the \n","loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; \n","• \n","part of the principal balance has been charged off; or \n","• \n","for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the \n","related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in \n","the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien \n","delinquency status. \n","Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are \n","generally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past \n","due. \n","When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the \n","accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and \n","suspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate \n","collectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a \n","nonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash \n","collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan \n","to zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise, \n","interest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received. \n","Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent \n","interest and principal become current under the terms of the \n","loan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and \n","interest is no longer doubtful. \n","We may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a \n","restructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of \n","sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial \n","strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios \n","and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated \n","performance under the previous terms and the underwriting \n","process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the \n","restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing \n","status. Loans will be placed on nonaccrual status and we may \n","record a charge-off if the re-underwriting did not include an \n","evaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay or we believe it is \n","probable that principal and interest contractually due under the \n","modified terms of the agreement will not be collectible. Modified \n","loans that are placed on nonaccrual status will generally return to \n","accrual status when repayment of principal and interest is \n","reasonably assured and the borrower has demonstrated a \n","sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive \n","months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of payments made \n","prior to a modification, if applicable). \n","Our loans are considered past due when contractually \n","required principal or interest payments have not been made on \n","the due dates. \n","LOAN CHARGE-OFF POLICIES  For commercial loans, we generally \n","fully charge off or charge down to net realizable value (fair value \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","92 \n","(continued) \n","  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Note 1:\n","of collateral, less estimated costs to sell) for loans secured by \n","collateral when: \n","• \n","management judges the loan to be uncollectible; \n","• \n","repayment is deemed to be protracted beyond reasonable \n","time frames; \n","• \n","the loan has been classified as a loss by either our internal \n","loan review process or our banking regulatory agencies; \n","• \n","the customer has filed bankruptcy and the loss becomes \n","evident owing to a lack of assets; \n","• \n","the loan is 180 days past due unless both well-secured and in \n","the process of collection; or \n","• \n","the loan is probable of foreclosure, and we have received an \n","appraisal of less than the recorded loan balance. \n","For consumer loans, we fully charge off or charge down to \n","net realizable value when deemed uncollectible due to \n","bankruptcy or other factors, or no later than reaching a defined \n","number of days past due, as follows: \n","• \n","Residential mortgage loans – We generally charge down to \n","net realizable value when the loan is 180 days past due and \n","fully charge-off when the loan exceeds extended \n","delinquency dates. \n","• \n","Auto loans – We generally fully charge off when the loan is \n","120 days past due. \n","• \n","Credit card loans – We generally fully charge off when the \n","loan is 180 days past due. \n","• \n","Unsecured loans – We generally fully charge off when the \n","loan is 120 days past due. \n","• \n","Unsecured lines – We generally fully charge off when the \n","loan is 180 days past due. \n","• \n","Other secured loans – We generally fully or partially charge \n","down to net realizable value when the loan is 120 days past \n","due. \n","FORECLOSED ASSETS  Foreclosed assets obtained through our \n","lending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans \n","have been written down to their net realizable value prior to \n","foreclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is \n","recorded with a charge to the ACL at foreclosure. We allow up to \n","90 days after foreclosure to finalize determination of net \n","realizable value. Thereafter, changes in net realizable value are \n","recorded to noninterest expense. The net realizable value of \n","these assets is reviewed and updated periodically depending on \n","the type of property. Certain government-guaranteed mortgage \n","loans upon foreclosure are included in accounts receivable, not \n","foreclosed assets. These receivables were loans insured by the \n","Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the \n","Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are measured based on \n","the balance expected to be recovered from the FHA or VA. \n","Allowance for Credit Losses \n","The ACL is management’s estimate of the current expected life-\n","time credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit \n","commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and \n","unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for \n","sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for AFS and HTM debt \n","securities, other financing receivables measured at amortized \n","cost, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. While we \n","attribute portions of the allowance to specific financial asset \n","classes (loan and debt security portfolios), loan portfolio \n","segments (commercial and consumer) or major security type, the \n","entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \n","Our ACL process involves procedures to appropriately \n","consider the unique risk characteristics of our financial asset \n","classes, portfolio segments, and major security types. For each \n","loan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt security type, \n","losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans or securities \n","with similar risk characteristics. For loans and securities that do \n","not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, \n","the losses are estimated individually, which generally includes our \n","nonperforming large commercial loans and non-accruing HTM \n","debt securities. For AFS debt securities, losses are estimated at \n","the individual security level. \n","Our ACL amounts are influenced by a variety of factors, \n","including changes in loan and debt security volumes, portfolio \n","credit quality, and general economic conditions. General \n","economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables \n","which will create volatility as those variables change over time. \n","See Table 1.3 for key economic variables used for our loan \n","portfolios. \n","Table 1.3: Key Economic Variables \n","Loan Portfolio \n","Key economic variables \n","Total commercial \n","•      Gross domestic product \n","•      Commercial real estate asset prices, where applicable \n","•      Unemployment rate \n","Residential mortgage \n","•      Home price index \n","•      Unemployment rate \n","Other consumer (including credit card, auto, and other consumer) \n","•      Unemployment rate \n","Our approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses \n","for loans and debt securities includes the following key \n","components: \n","• \n","An initial loss forecast period of two years for all portfolio \n","segments and classes of financing receivables and off-\n","balance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects \n","management’s expectation of losses based on forward-\n","looking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast \n","multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base \n","scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more \n","pessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by \n","management to estimate future credit losses. \n","• \n","Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting \n","to the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the \n","economic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast \n","period. These long-term averages are based on observations \n","over multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which \n","may be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \n","• \n","The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for \n","expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, \n","renewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term \n","when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual \n","renewals or extension options. Credit card loans have \n","indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine \n","93 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","a contractual life by estimating the application of future \n","payments to the outstanding loan amount. \n","• \n","For AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests \n","classified as HTM, we utilize DCF methods to measure the \n","ACL, which incorporate expected credit losses using the \n","conceptual components described above. For most HTM \n","debt securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss \n","model, similar to the methodology used for loans. \n","The ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \n","valuation account that is deducted from, or added to, the \n","amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net \n","amount expected to be collected. When credit expectations \n","change, the valuation account is adjusted with changes reported \n","in provision for credit losses. If amounts previously charged off \n","are subsequently expected to be collected, we may recognize a \n","negative allowance, which is limited to the amount that was \n","previously charged off. For financial assets with an ACL \n","estimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the \n","passage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS \n","debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to \n","expected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is \n","less than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot \n","have an associated negative allowance. \n","For certain financial assets, such as residential real estate \n","loans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage \n","Association (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. \n","Treasury and Agency mortgage-backed debt securities and \n","certain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not \n","recognized an ACL as our expectation of loss is zero, based on \n","historical losses and consideration of current and forecasted \n","conditions. \n","For financial assets that are collateral-dependent, we use the \n","fair value of the collateral to measure the ACL. If we intend to sell \n","the underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the \n","collateral’s net realizable value. In most situations, based on our \n","charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial \n","asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For \n","consumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have \n","collateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other \n","personal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent \n","financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial \n","real estate or other business assets. \n","We do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest \n","receivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed \n","through interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-\n","accrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For \n","consumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we \n","include an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are \n","neither placed on nonaccrual status nor written off until the loan \n","is 180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in \n","other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit \n","card loans. \n","COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY \n","Generally, commercial loans, which include net investments in \n","lease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each \n","loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic \n","reviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio \n","reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with \n","the borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the \n","event of default, considering the quality of any underlying \n","collateral. Probability of default, loss severity at the time of \n","default, and exposure at default are statistically derived through \n","historical observations of default and losses after default within \n","each credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as \n","appropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted \n","economic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit \n","commitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to \n","derive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated \n","probability of default and loss severity at the time of default are \n","applied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses \n","for unfunded credit commitments. \n","CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  For \n","consumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled \n","approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans \n","within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that \n","estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of \n","default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to \n","estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, \n","generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such \n","as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. \n","As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further \n","stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, \n","geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use \n","attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation \n","(FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the \n","development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home \n","price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic \n","variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses \n","in the consumer portfolio. \n","OTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for \n","qualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our \n","loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment \n","of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the \n","ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level \n","below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic \n","environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, \n","process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry \n","trends and emerging risk assessments. \n","OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES  Our off-balance sheet \n","credit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally \n","in the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not \n","accounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including \n","standby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-\n","balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated \n","with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for \n","commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our \n","discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial \n","guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as \n","loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for \n","off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in \n","accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated \n","balance sheet. \n","OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated \n","for expected credit losses. These other financial assets include \n","accounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-\n","sponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage \n","Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage \n","Corporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts \n","receivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as \n","central clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are \n","generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss \n","expectation (e.g., government guarantee) based on no historical \n","credit losses and consideration of current and forecasted \n","conditions. Some financial assets, such as loans to employees, \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","94 \n","(continued) \n","  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Note 1:\n","maintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with the related \n","amortized cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated \n","balance sheet. A provision for credit losses is not recognized \n","separately from the regular income or expense associated with \n","these financial assets. \n","Securities purchased under resale agreements are generally \n","over-collateralized by securities or cash and are generally short-\n","term in nature. We have elected the practical expedient for these \n","financial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These \n","provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and \n","customers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. \n","Accordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these \n","financial assets. \n","See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \n","for additional information. \n","Purchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \n","Financial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with \n","more than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since \n","their origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated \n","(PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities \n","and loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an \n","ACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, \n","there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; \n","rather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial \n","asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a \n","corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected \n","credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for \n","credit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income \n","recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest \n","income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset. \n","Leasing Activity \n","AS LESSOR  We lease equipment to our customers under \n","financing or operating leases. Financing leases, which includes \n","both direct financing and sales-type leases, are presented in \n","loans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease \n","payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the \n","leased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing \n","leases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-\n","party investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual \n","lease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that \n","we believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The \n","residual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales \n","price for the equipment at lease termination based on sales \n","history adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets. \n","Many of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at \n","prevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at \n","lease termination. \n","Our allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers \n","both the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as \n","the estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically \n","purchase residual value insurance on our financing leases to \n","reduce the risk of loss at lease termination. \n","In connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s \n","purchase of other products or services from the equipment \n","vendor and allocate the contract consideration between the use \n","of the asset and the purchase of those products or services. \n","Amounts allocated are reported in loans as commercial and \n","industrial loans, rather than as lease financing. \n","Our primary income from financing leases is interest income \n","recognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease \n","revenue, such as reimbursement for property taxes, are included \n","in lease income within noninterest income. \n","Operating lease assets are presented in other assets, net of \n","accumulated depreciation. Periodic depreciation expense is \n","recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of \n","the leased asset and are included in other noninterest expense. \n","Operating lease assets are reviewed periodically for impairment \n","and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of \n","operating lease assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. \n","Recoverability is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of \n","the leased assets to undiscounted cash flows expected through \n","the operation or sale of the asset. Impairment charges for \n","operating lease assets are included in other noninterest income. \n","Operating lease rental income for leased assets is recognized \n","in lease income within noninterest income on a straight-line basis \n","over the lease term. Variable revenue on operating leases include \n","reimbursements of costs, including property taxes, which \n","fluctuate over time, as well as rental revenue based on usage. For \n","leases of railcars, revenue for maintenance services provided \n","under the lease is recognized in lease income. \n","We elected to exclude from revenue and expenses any sales \n","tax incurred on lease payments which are reimbursed by the \n","lessee. Substantially all of our leased assets are protected against \n","casualty loss through third-party insurance. \n","AS LESSEE We enter into lease agreements to obtain the right to \n","use assets for our business operations, substantially all of which \n","are real estate. Lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets are \n","recognized when we enter into operating or financing leases and \n","represent our obligations and rights to use these assets over the \n","period of the leases and may be re-measured for certain \n","modifications. \n","Operating lease liabilities include fixed and in-substance \n","fixed payments for the contractual duration of the lease, \n","adjusted for renewals or terminations which were considered \n","probable of exercise when measured. The lease payments are \n","discounted using a rate that approximates a collateralized \n","borrowing rate for the estimated duration of the lease as the \n","implicit discount rate is typically not known. The discount rate is \n","updated when re-measurement events occur. The related \n","operating lease ROU assets may differ from operating lease \n","liabilities due to initial direct costs, deferred or prepaid lease \n","payments and lease incentives. \n","We present operating lease liabilities in accrued expenses \n","and other liabilities and the related operating lease ROU assets in \n","other assets. The amortization of operating lease ROU assets \n","and the accretion of operating lease liabilities are reported \n","together as fixed lease expense and are included in occupancy \n","expense within noninterest expense. The fixed lease expense is \n","recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. \n","Some operating leases include variable lease payments and \n","are recognized as incurred in net occupancy expense within \n","noninterest expense. \n","For substantially all of our leased assets, we account for \n","consideration paid under the contract for maintenance or other \n","services as lease payments. We exclude certain asset classes, with \n","original terms of less than one year from the operating lease \n","ROU assets and lease liabilities. The related short-term lease \n","expense is included in net occupancy expense. \n","Finance lease liabilities are presented in long-term debt and \n","the associated finance ROU assets are presented in premises and \n","equipment. \n","See Note 8 (Leasing Activity) for additional information. \n","95 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Deposits, Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt \n","Customer deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt \n","are recorded at amortized cost, unless we have elected the fair \n","value option for these items. For example, we may elect the fair \n","value option for certain structured notes. We generally report \n","borrowings with original maturities of one year or less as short-\n","term borrowings and borrowings with original maturities of \n","greater than one year as long-term debt on our consolidated \n","balance sheet. We do not reclassify long-term debt to short-\n","term borrowings within a year of maturity. \n","Refer to Note 9 (Deposits) for further information on \n","deposits, Note 10 (Long-Term Debt) for further information on \n","long-term debt, and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \n","Liabilities) for additional information on fair value, including fair \n","value option elections. \n","Securitizations and Beneficial Interests \n","Securitizations are transactions in which financial assets are sold \n","to a Special Purpose Entity (SPE), which then issues beneficial \n","interests collateralized by the transferred financial assets. \n","Beneficial interests are generally issued in the form of senior and \n","subordinated interests, and in some cases, we may obtain \n","beneficial interests issued by the SPE. Additionally, from time to \n","time, we may re-securitize certain financial assets in a new \n","securitization transaction. See Note 16 (Securitizations and \n","Variable Interest Entities) for additional information about our \n","involvement with SPEs. \n","The assets and liabilities transferred to a SPE are excluded \n","from our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies \n","as a sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. \n","For transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we \n","recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained \n","(including beneficial interests or mortgage servicing rights) and \n","all liabilities incurred. We record a gain or loss in noninterest \n","income for the difference between assets obtained (net of \n","liabilities incurred) and the carrying amount of the assets sold. \n","Beneficial interests obtained from, and liabilities incurred in, \n","securitizations with off-balance sheet entities may include debt \n","and equity securities, loans, MSRs, derivative assets and \n","liabilities, other assets, and other obligations such as liabilities \n","for mortgage repurchase losses or long-term debt and are \n","accounted for as described within this Note. \n","Mortgage Servicing Rights \n","We recognize MSRs resulting from a sale or securitization of \n","mortgage loans that we originate or through a direct purchase of \n","such rights. We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. \n","Subsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. \n","Commercial MSRs are subsequently measured at LOCOM. The \n","valuation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in Note 6 \n","(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets \n","and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \n","Entities). \n","For MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are \n","reported in mortgage banking noninterest income in the period \n","in which the change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at \n","LOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, \n","estimated net servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is \n","reported in mortgage banking noninterest income, analyzed \n","monthly and adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment rates, as \n","well as other factors. \n","MSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated \n","for impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For \n","purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we \n","stratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of \n","the underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by \n","individual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds \n","fair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation \n","allowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. \n","Premises and Equipment \n","Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated \n","depreciation and amortization. We use the straight-line method \n","of depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization \n","expense for premises and equipment was $1.3 billion in 2023, \n","$1.2 billion in 2022, and $1.4 billion in 2021. Estimated useful \n","lives range up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, up to \n","10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the \n","estimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease term for \n","leasehold improvements. \n","Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets \n","Goodwill is recorded for business combinations when the \n","purchase price is higher than the fair value of the acquired net \n","assets, including identifiable intangible assets. \n","We assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level \n","on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. \n","We have determined that our reporting units are at the \n","reportable operating segment level or one level below. We \n","identify the reporting units based on how the segments and \n","reporting units are managed, taking into consideration the \n","economic characteristics, nature of the products and services, \n","and customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate \n","goodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair \n","value at the time we acquire a business and when we have a \n","significant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion \n","of goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested \n","business. \n","We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment \n","of goodwill. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative test and \n","proceed directly to a quantitative test. If we perform a qualitative \n","assessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is \n","more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater \n","than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. \n","However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a \n","reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we \n","complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is \n","goodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation \n","methodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings \n","multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, \n","which is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. \n","A goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less \n","than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill \n","impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to \n","the reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge \n","to other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying \n","value of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment \n","are prohibited. \n","We amortize customer relationship intangible assets on an \n","accelerated basis over useful lives not exceeding 10 years. We \n","review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or \n","changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts \n","may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of \n","undiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the \n","carrying value of the asset.

On the date we enter into a derivative \n","contract, we categorize the derivative as either an accounting \n","hedge, economic hedge, or part of our customer accommodation \n","trading portfolio. \n","Accounting hedges are either fair value or cash flow hedges. \n","Fair value hedges represent the hedge of the fair value of a \n","recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm \n","commitment, including hedges of foreign currency exposure. \n","Cash flow hedges represent the hedge of a forecasted \n","transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received \n","related to a recognized asset or liability. \n","Economic hedges and customer accommodation trading \n","derivatives do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply, \n","hedge accounting. Economic hedges are derivatives we \n","use to manage interest rate, foreign currency and certain other \n","risks associated with our non-trading activities. Our customer \n","accommodation trading portfolio represents derivatives related \n","to our trading business activities. We report changes in the fair \n","values of these derivatives in noninterest income or noninterest \n","expense. \n","FAIR VALUE HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \n","derivative in income, except for certain derivatives in which a \n","portion is recorded to OCI. We record basis adjustments to the \n","amortized cost of the hedged asset or liability due to the changes \n","in fair value related to the hedged risk, except for basis \n","adjustments related to active portfolio layer method hedges \n","which are maintained at a portfolio level and not allocated to the \n","individual assets in the portfolio. The offset to fair value hedge \n","basis adjustments is recorded in earnings. We present derivative \n","gains or losses in the same income statement category as the \n","hedged asset or liability, as follows: \n","• \n","For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, amounts are \n","reflected in net interest income; \n","• \n","For hedges of foreign currency risk, amounts representing \n","the fair value changes less the accrual for periodic cash flow \n","settlements are reflected in noninterest income. The \n","periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest \n","income; \n","• \n","For hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency \n","risk, amounts representing the fair value change less the \n","accrual for periodic cash flow settlements is attributed to \n","both net interest income and noninterest income. The \n","periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest \n","income. \n","The entire derivative gain or loss is included in the \n","assessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge \n","relationships, except for hedges of foreign-currency \n","denominated AFS debt securities and long-term debt liabilities \n","hedged with cross-currency swaps. The change in fair value of \n","these swaps attributable to cross-currency basis spread changes \n","is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The \n","initial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to net \n","interest income and the difference between changes in fair value \n","of the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings \n","is recorded in OCI. \n","CASH FLOW HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \n","derivative in OCI. We subsequently reclassify gains and losses \n","from these changes in fair value from OCI to earnings in the same \n","period(s) that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the \n","same income statement category as the hedged item. The entire \n","gain or loss on these derivatives is included in the assessment of \n","hedge effectiveness. \n","DOCUMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT FOR \n","ACCOUNTING HEDGES For fair value and cash flow hedges \n","qualifying for hedge accounting, we formally document at \n","inception the relationship between hedging instruments and \n","hedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our \n","evaluation of effectiveness for our hedge transactions. This \n","process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or \n","cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on our \n","consolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. \n","We assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at \n","inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. \n","For fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing \n","the periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument \n","against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability \n","being hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow \n","hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic \n","changes in fair value of the hedging instrument against the \n","periodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The \n","hypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and \n","offset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged \n","due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for \n","fair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the \n","quantitative measures of the regression results used to validate \n","the conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we \n","also formally assess whether the derivative we designated in \n","each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly \n","effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the \n","hedged item using the regression analysis method. \n","For portfolio layer method fair value hedges, an assessment \n","test is also performed at inception of the hedging relationship \n","and on an ongoing basis to support our expectation that the \n","hedged item is anticipated to be outstanding for the designated \n","hedge period. \n","DISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING  We discontinue hedge \n","accounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly \n","effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a \n","hedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or \n","exercised, (3) we elect to discontinue hedge accounting, (4) the \n","forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in a \n","cash flow hedge, or (5) the hedged item is no longer anticipated \n","to be outstanding for the designated hedge period in a portfolio \n","layer method hedge. \n","When we discontinue fair value hedge accounting for \n","portfolio layer method hedges, the associated portfolio level \n","basis adjustment is allocated to the remaining securities in the \n","portfolio on a proportionate basis. Upon discontinuance of all \n","other fair value hedges, we no longer adjust the previously \n","hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. \n","The remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item \n","and accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in \n","the same manner as other components of the carrying amount \n","of the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt \n","instruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, \n","these amounts are amortized into net interest income over the \n","remaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized \n","cost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the \n","accumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately \n","reclassified to net interest income. If the derivative continues to \n","be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we carry the \n","derivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with \n","changes in fair value included in noninterest income. \n","97 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","When we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is \n","probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the \n","accumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date \n","continues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction \n","affects earnings at which point the related OCI amount is \n","reclassified to net interest income. If cash flow hedge accounting \n","is discontinued and it is no longer probable the forecasted \n","transaction will occur, the accumulated gains and losses reported \n","in OCI at the de-designation date is immediately reclassified to \n","noninterest income. If the derivative continues to be held after \n","cash flow hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on our \n","consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair \n","value included in noninterest income. \n","EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  We may purchase or originate financial \n","instruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception \n","of the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic \n","characteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and \n","closely related to the economic characteristics of the host \n","contract, (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the \n","embedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at \n","fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if \n","a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded \n","instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the \n","embedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate \n","it from the hybrid contract by recording the bifurcated derivative \n","at fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference \n","between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of \n","the bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at \n","fair value and accounted for in accordance with its categorization \n","as an accounting hedge, economic hedge, or customer \n","accommodation trading derivative. The accounting for the \n","remaining host contract is the same as other assets and liabilities \n","of a similar type and reported on our consolidated balance sheet \n","based upon the accounting classification of the instrument. \n","COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING  By using derivatives, \n","we are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that \n","counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as \n","expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty \n","credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset \n","on our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a \n","derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to \n","the extent subject to legally enforceable master netting \n","arrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same \n","counterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize \n","counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, \n","monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements \n","and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit \n","risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value \n","and our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent \n","derivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the \n","applicable requirements, including determining the legal \n","enforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present \n","derivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on \n","our consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to \n","reflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments \n","(CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, \n","which considers the effects of enforceable master netting \n","agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based \n","views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate \n","CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap \n","market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the \n","counterparties to our derivatives. \n","Cash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate \n","derivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with \n","centrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the \n","derivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to \n","separate non-derivative receivables or payables. This cash \n","collateral, also referred to as variation margin, is exchanged \n","based upon derivative fair value changes, typically on a one-day \n","lag. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging \n","activities, see Note 14 (Derivatives). \n","Equity Securities \n","Equity securities exclude investments that represent a \n","controlling interest in the investee. Marketable equity securities \n","have readily determinable fair values and are predominantly used \n","in our trading activities. Marketable equity securities are \n","recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and \n","losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in \n","noninterest income. Dividend income from marketable equity \n","securities is recognized in interest income. \n","Nonmarketable equity securities do not have readily \n","determinable fair values. These securities are accounted for \n","under one of the following accounting methods: \n","• \n","Fair value through net income: This method is an election. \n","The securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains \n","or losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities \n","in noninterest income; \n","• \n","Equity method: This method is applied when we have the \n","ability to exert significant influence over the investee. The \n","securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of \n","the investee’s earnings or losses, less any dividends received \n","and/or impairment. Equity method adjustments for our \n","share of the investee’s earnings or losses are recognized in \n","other noninterest income and dividends are recognized as a \n","reduction of the investment carrying value; \n","• \n","Proportional amortization method: This method is applied to \n","certain low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. \n","The investments are initially recorded at cost and amortized \n","in proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of \n","the investments and the related tax impacts are recognized \n","in income tax expense; \n","• \n","Cost method: This method is required for specific securities, \n","such as Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan \n","Bank stock. These securities are held at cost less any \n","impairment; \n","• \n","Measurement alternative: This method is followed by all \n","remaining nonmarketable equity securities. These securities \n","are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value \n","as of the date of an orderly observable transaction of the \n","same or similar security of the same issuer. These securities \n","are also adjusted for impairment. \n","All realized and unrealized gains and losses, including \n","impairment losses, from nonmarketable equity securities are \n","recognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest \n","income. Dividend income from all nonmarketable equity \n","securities, other than equity method securities, is recognized in \n","interest income. \n","Our review for impairment for nonmarketable equity \n","securities not carried at fair value includes an analysis of the facts \n","and circumstances of each security, the intent or requirement to \n","sell the security, the expectations of cash flows, capital needs and \n","the viability of its business model. When the fair value of an \n","equity method or cost method investment is less than its \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","98 \n","(continued) \n","  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Note 1:\n","carrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value when we \n","consider declines in value to be other than temporary. When \n","the fair value of an investment accounted for using the \n","measurement alternative is less than its carrying value, we write-\n","down the asset to fair value, without the consideration of \n","anticipated recovery. \n","See Note 4 (Equity Securities) for additional information. \n","Pension Accounting \n","We sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit \n","retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan \n","(Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of \n","Wells Fargo. We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans \n","that provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to \n","certain eligible employees. We account for our defined benefit \n","pension plans using an actuarial model. Principal assumptions \n","used in determining the net periodic pension cost and the \n","pension obligation include the discount rate, the expected long-\n","term rate of return on plan assets and projected mortality rates. \n","A single weighted-average discount rate is used to estimate \n","the present value of our future pension benefit obligations. We \n","determine the discount rate using a yield curve derived from a \n","broad-based population of high-quality corporate bonds with \n","maturity dates that closely match the estimated timing of the \n","expected benefit payments. \n","We use the full year curve approach to estimate the interest \n","cost component of pension expense for our principal defined \n","benefit and postretirement plans. The full yield curve approach \n","aligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected \n","benefit payment cash flows. \n","The determination of our expected long-term rate of return \n","on plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the \n","current asset allocations and expected returns using forward-\n","looking capital market assumptions. We use the resulting \n","projections to derive a baseline expected rate of return for the \n","Cash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix. \n","Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables \n","published by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our \n","specific experience. \n","At year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan \n","liabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting \n","actuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial \n","gain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from AOCI into net periodic \n","pension cost over the estimated average remaining participation \n","period, which at December 31, 2023, is 17 years. See Note 22 \n","(Employee Benefits) for additional information on our pension \n","accounting. \n","Income Taxes \n","We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we \n","operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: \n","current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax \n","expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded \n","for the current period and includes income tax expense related to \n","uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the \n","more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to \n","determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax \n","position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that \n","management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of \n","realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our \n","realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \n","Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \n","method and deferred income tax expense results from changes \n","in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the \n","balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is \n","based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and \n","tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates \n","and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. \n","Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s \n","judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation \n","allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. \n","See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \n","Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes \n","and related income tax assets and liabilities. \n","Stock-Based Compensation \n","Our long-term incentive plans provide awards for employee \n","services in various forms, such as restricted share rights (RSRs) \n","and performance share awards (PSAs). \n","Stock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant \n","date. The cost is recognized in personnel expense, net of actual \n","forfeitures, in our consolidated statement of income normally \n","over the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting \n","are expensed on a straight-line method. Awards to employees \n","who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to \n","immediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who \n","become retirement eligible before the final vesting date are \n","expensed between the grant date and the date the employee \n","becomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other \n","limited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment \n","ends. \n","For PSAs, compensation expense fluctuates based on the \n","estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions. The \n","total expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized \n","upon the completion of the performance period. \n","For additional information on our stock-based employee \n","compensation plans, see Note 12 (Common Stock and Stock \n","Plans). \n","Earnings Per Common Share \n","We compute earnings per common share by dividing net income \n","applicable to common stock (net income less dividends on \n","preferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over \n","carrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the \n","average number of common shares outstanding during the \n","period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using \n","net income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of \n","common stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are \n","dilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding \n","during the period. \n","Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities \n","Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an \n","asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \n","between market participants at the measurement date. Fair \n","value is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of \n","observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \n","We measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we \n","are required to record them at fair value, when we have elected \n","the fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure \n","requirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a \n","recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are \n","recorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value \n","measurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that \n","are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to \n","fair value only as required through the application of an \n","accounting method such as LOCOM, write-downs of individual \n","assets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain \n","nonmarketable equity securities. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","99 \n","We classify our assets and liabilities measured at fair value \n","based upon a three-level hierarchy that assigns the highest \n","priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \n","lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels are as \n","follows: \n","• \n","Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical \n","instruments traded in active markets. \n","• \n","Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar \n","instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or \n","similar instruments in markets that are not active, and \n","model-based valuation techniques for which all significant \n","assumptions are observable in the market. \n","• \n","Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use \n","significant assumptions that are not observable in the \n","market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our \n","estimates of assumptions that market participants would \n","use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques \n","include use of discounted cash flow models, market \n","comparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar \n","techniques. \n","We monitor the availability of observable market data to \n","assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments \n","within the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1, \n","Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes \n","but is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions. \n","Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will \n","drive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes \n","in availability of observable market data, which also may result in \n","changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of \n","transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The amounts \n","reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning \n","of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. \n","See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for a more \n","detailed discussion of the valuation methodologies that we apply \n","to our assets and liabilities. \n","Supplemental Cash Flow Information \n","Significant noncash activities are presented in Table 1.4. \n","Table 1.4: Supplemental Cash Flow Information \n","Year ended December 31, \n","(in millions) \n","2023 \n","2022 \n","2021 \n","Held-to-maturity debt securities purchased from securitization of loans held for sale \n","$ \n","94 \n","745 \n","20,265 \n","Transfers from loans to loans held for sale \n","1,920 \n","6,586 \n","19,297 \n","Transfers from available-for-sale debt securities to held-to-maturity debt securities \n","3,687 \n","50,132 \n","55,993 \n","Transfers from held-to-maturity debt securities to available-for-sale debt securities (1) \n","23,919 \n","— \n","— \n","(1) \n","In first quarter 2023, we reclassified HTM debt securities to AFS debt securities in connection with the adoption of ASU 2022-01. \n","Subsequent Events \n","We have evaluated the effects of events that have occurred \n","subsequent to December 31, 2023, and there have been no \n","material events that would require recognition in our 2023 \n","consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to \n","the consolidated financial statements. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","100 \n","(continued) \n","  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n","Note 1:\n","Note 2: Trading Activities \n","Table 2.1 presents a summary of our trading assets and liabilities \n","measured at fair value through earnings. \n","Table 2.1: Trading Assets and Liabilities \n","(in millions) \n","Dec 31, \n","2023 \n","Dec 31, \n","2022 \n","Trading assets: \n","Debt securities \n","$ \n","97,302 \n","86,155 \n","Equity securities \n","18,449 \n","26,910 \n","Loans held for sale \n","1,793 \n","1,466 \n","Gross trading derivative assets \n","71,990 \n","77,148 \n","Netting (1) \n","(54,069) \n","(54,922) \n","Total trading derivative assets \n","17,921 \n","22,226 \n","Total trading assets \n","135,465 \n","136,757 \n","Trading liabilities: \n","Short sale and other liabilities \n","25,471 \n","20,304 \n","Interest-bearing deposits \n","1,297 \n","— \n","Long-term debt \n","2,308 \n","1,346 \n","Gross trading derivative liabilities \n","77,807 \n","77,698 \n","Netting (1) \n","(60,366) \n","(59,232) \n","Total trading derivative liabilities \n","17,441 \n","18,466 \n","Total trading liabilities \n","$ \n","46,517 \n","40,116 \n","(1) \n","Represents balance sheet netting for trading derivative asset and liability balances, and trading portfolio level counterparty valuation adjustments. \n","Table 2.2 provides net interest income earned from trading \n","securities, and net gains and losses due to the realized and \n","unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. \n","Net interest income also includes dividend income on \n","trading securities and dividend expense on trading securities we \n","have sold, but not yet purchased. \n","Table 2.2: Net Interest Income and Net Gains (Losses) from Trading Activities \n","Year ended December 31, \n","(in millions) \n","2023 \n","2022 \n","2021 \n","Net interest income: \n","Interest income (1) \n","$ \n","4,229 \n","3,011 \n","2,567 \n","Interest expense \n","643 \n","592 \n","405 \n","Total net interest income \n","3,586 \n","2,419 \n","2,162 \n","Net gains (losses) from trading activities, by risk type: \n","Interest rate \n","444 \n","456 \n","(587) \n","Commodity \n","372 \n","345 \n","10 \n","Equity \n","1,106 \n","883 \n","52 \n","Foreign exchange \n","2,124 \n","1,168 \n","839 \n","Credit \n","753 \n","(736) \n","(30) \n","Total net gains from trading activities \n","4,799 \n","2,116 \n","284 \n","Total trading-related net interest and noninterest income \n","$ \n","8,385 \n","4,535 \n","2,446 \n","(1) \n","Substantially all relates to interest income on debt and equity securities. \n","101 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Note 3:  Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities \n","Table 3.1 provides the amortized cost, net of the allowance for \n","credit losses (ACL) for debt securities, and fair value by major \n","categories of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, which are \n","carried at fair value, and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, \n","which are carried at amortized cost, net of the ACL.

Loan \n","delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-\n","to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary \n","credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our \n","evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer \n","loan portfolio segment. \n","Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for \n","loans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency \n","is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of \n","our ACL for consumer loans. \n","We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are \n","generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited \n","circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit \n","Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain \n","loan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due \n","to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. \n","LTV is the ratio of the outstanding loan balance divided by \n","the property collateral value. For junior lien mortgages, we use \n","the total combined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages \n","(including unused line of credit amounts). We obtain LTVs using a \n","cascade approach which first uses values provided by automated \n","valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not \n","available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised \n","value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the \n","property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised \n","value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method \n","considered for high value properties, generally with an original \n","value of $1.5 million or more as of December 31, 2023, and \n","$1.0 million or more as of December 31, 2022, as the AVM values \n","have proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we \n","update LTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an \n","LTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios \n","acquired from or serviced by other institutions. \n","Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following \n","table for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we monitor \n","as part of our credit risk management practices; however, \n","charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan \n","portfolio. \n","Credit quality information is provided with the year of \n","origination for term loans.

Commercial \n","loan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \n","borrower’s request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \n","individual basis. \n","Our consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \n","product and the modification program offered to the borrower, \n","and may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term \n","extensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \n","combination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \n","loan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \n","payment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \n","a result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \n","interest. \n","Our residential mortgage loan modification programs may \n","offer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower’s \n","demonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \n","is needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \n","loan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \n","period of three months to determine if the borrower can perform \n","in accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \n","terms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \n","through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \n","original terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \n","our loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \n","successfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \n","is formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \n","payment period totaled $109 million at December 31, 2023. \n","Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \n","credit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or \n","long-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \n","reduces the borrower’s interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \n","interest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \n","interest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \n","period, the borrower’s revolving charge privileges are revoked. \n","Auto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \n","three months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. \n","The following disclosures provide information on loan \n","modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \n","difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \n","reductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \n","months) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \n","these modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \n","modifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \n","following the modification.

In addition, Wells Fargo and our \n","subsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or \n","otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct \n","of investigations of other persons or industry groups. \n","We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses \n","associated with the actions become probable and the costs can \n","be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the \n","amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of \n","potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if \n","we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low \n","end of the range of those potential losses. There can be no \n","assurance as to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including \n","the matters described below, and the actual costs of resolving \n","legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the \n","amounts accrued for those actions. \n","ADVISORY ACCOUNT CASH SWEEP INVESTIGATION The United \n","States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has \n","undertaken an investigation regarding the cash sweep options \n","that the Company provides to investment advisory clients at \n","account opening. \n","COMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS Federal government agencies, \n","including the United States Department of Labor (Department \n","of Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions \n","associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of \n","the Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the \n","401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with \n","the Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously \n","disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve \n","the Department of Labor’s review. On September 26, 2022, \n","participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class \n","action in the United States District Court for the District of \n","Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee \n","Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with \n","certain of these transactions. \n","HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS  Government agencies, including the \n","United States Department of Justice and the SEC, have \n","undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations \n","regarding the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. The \n","United States Department of Justice and the SEC have since \n","closed their investigations without taking action.

Allegations related to the \n","Company’s hiring practices related to diversity are also among \n","the subjects of shareholder derivative lawsuits pending in the \n","United States District Court for the Northern District of \n","California and in the Delaware Court of Chancery. \n","INTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of \n","merchants have filed putative class actions, and individual \n","merchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, \n","N.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and \n","Wachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated \n","with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, \n","MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding \n","companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These \n","actions have been consolidated in the United States District \n","Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and \n","consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based \n","on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks \n","damages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege \n","that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully \n","colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that \n","enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged \n","tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are \n","anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other \n","defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment \n","Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other \n","entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the \n","Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and \n","the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed \n","a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to \n","resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate \n","settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The \n","settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the \n","consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately \n","$6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants \n","opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided \n","for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of \n","default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period \n","of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final \n","approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United \n","States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement \n","objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the \n","settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On \n","June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement \n","agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action \n","to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n","New York for further proceedings. On November 30, 2016, the \n","district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class \n","and an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a \n","settlement agreement to resolve the damages class claims \n","pursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately \n","$6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3 billion of funds \n","remaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in \n","additional funding. The Company’s allocated responsibility for \n","the additional funding is approximately $94.5 million. The court \n","granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, \n","which was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n","Second Circuit by settlement objector merchants. On March 15, \n","2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the damages class settlement. \n","On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ \n","motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several \n","of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled \n","while others remain pending. \n","136 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION  In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \n","Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a \n","complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern \n","District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, \n","N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential \n","mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising \n","similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the \n","Southern District of New York, IKB International and IKB \n","Deutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, \n","and Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state \n","court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, \n","N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert \n","causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s \n","alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of \n","mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations \n","and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and \n","abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events \n","of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix \n","Light’s claims and certain of the claims asserted by \n","Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each \n","case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix \n","Light and Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court’s \n","decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \n","Circuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, \n","terminating its case. In November 2023, the Company entered \n","into an agreement with IKB to resolve IKB’s claims. The Company \n","previously settled two class actions filed by institutional \n","investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union \n","Administration with similar allegations. \n","SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of \n","Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \n","Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \n","the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the \n","assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \n","to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as \n","plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. \n","OUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals \n","for legal actions when potential losses associated with the \n","actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \n","estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \n","losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and \n","estimable losses was approximately $1.7 billion as of \n","December 31, 2023. The outcomes of legal actions are \n","unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is \n","inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or \n","even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the \n","amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is \n","probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. \n","Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established \n","accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on \n","information currently available, advice of counsel, available \n","insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo \n","believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells \n","Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the \n","aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s \n","consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the \n","ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material \n","to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","137\n","Note 14: Derivatives \n","We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \n","interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to \n","assist customers with their risk management objectives. We \n","designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in \n","qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow \n","hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges \n","that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for \n","customer accommodation trading purposes. \n","Risk Management Derivatives \n","Our asset/liability management approach to interest rate, \n","foreign currency and certain other risks includes the use of \n","derivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash \n","flow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help \n","minimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair \n","values of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest \n","rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This \n","approach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of \n","certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, \n","foreign currency and other exposures, which may cause the \n","hedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have \n","a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows \n","and earnings. \n","Customer Accommodation Trading \n","We also use various derivatives, including interest rate, \n","commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, \n","as an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading \n","businesses. These derivative transactions, which involve \n","engaging in market-making activities or acting as an \n","intermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers \n","manage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from \n","such derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such \n","as separate derivative or security transactions. \n","Table 14.1 presents the total notional or contractual amounts \n","and fair values for our derivatives. Derivative transactions can be \n","measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is \n","not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when \n","viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of \n","the instruments. The notional amount is generally not \n","exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which derivative cash \n","flows are determined. \n","Table 14.1: Notional or Contractual Amounts and Fair Values of Derivatives \n","December 31, 2023 \n","December 31, 2022 \n","Fair value \n","Fair value \n","(in millions) \n","Notional \n","or contractual \n","amount \n","Derivative \n","assets \n","Derivative \n","liabilities \n","Notional \n","or contractual \n","amount \n","Derivative \n","assets \n","Derivative \n","liabilities \n","Derivatives designated as hedging instruments \n","Interest rate contracts \n","$ \n","357,096 \n","639 \n","570 \n","263,876 \n","670 \n","579 \n","Commodity contracts \n","2,600 \n","24 \n","12 \n","1,681 \n","9 \n","25 \n","Foreign exchange contracts \n","4,193 \n","60 \n","395 \n","15,544 \n","161 \n","1,015 \n","Total derivatives designated as qualifying hedging instruments \n","723 \n","977 \n","840 \n","1,619 \n","Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments \n","Interest rate contracts \n","10,409,720 \n","31,806 \n","36,312 \n","10,222,027 \n","40,416 \n","42,894 \n","Commodity contracts \n","88,491 \n","2,717 \n","2,734 \n","96,001 \n","5,991 \n","3,420 \n","Equity contracts (1) \n","438,458 \n","13,305 \n","13,810 \n","393,753 \n","9,573 \n","8,254 \n","Foreign exchange contracts \n","2,273,383 \n","24,707 \n","26,762 \n","1,513,363 \n","22,052 \n","25,671 \n","Credit contracts \n","60,439 \n","113 \n","44 \n","45,649 \n","66 \n","36 \n","Total derivatives not designated as hedging instruments \n","72,648 \n","79,662 \n","78,098 \n","80,275 \n","Total derivatives before netting \n","73,371 \n","80,639 \n","78,938 \n","81,894 \n","Netting \n","(55,148) \n","(62,144) \n","(56,164) \n","(61,827) \n","Total \n","$ \n","18,223 \n","18,495 \n","22,774 \n","20,067 \n","(1) \n","In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a \n","recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading \n","or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 15.1 in this Note. \n","Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments \n","on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments \n","typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value \n","(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or \n","application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable \n","equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring \n","basis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in \n","Table 15.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that \n","are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities \n","carried at amortized cost. \n","FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We classify our assets and liabilities \n","recorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value \n","hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations \n","based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \n","lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on \n","significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of \n","Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed \n","description of the fair value hierarchy. \n","In the determination of the classification of financial \n","instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we \n","consider all available information, including observable market \n","data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our \n","understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs \n","used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific \n","facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument \n","category and judgments are made regarding the significance of \n","the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value \n","measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \n","considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \n","We do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \n","fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value \n","(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to \n","measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published \n","NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy. \n","Assets \n","TRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded \n","at fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using \n","internal trader prices that are subject to independent price \n","verification procedures, which includes comparing internal trader \n","prices against multiple independent pricing sources, such as \n","prices obtained from third-party pricing services, observed \n","trades, and other approved market data. These pricing services \n","compile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing \n","for similar securities when no price is observable. We review \n","pricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine \n","if observable market information is being used versus \n","unobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an \n","internal trader price, compared with other independent pricing \n","sources, considerations include the range and quality of available \n","information and observability of trade data. These sources are \n","used to evaluate the reasonableness of a trader price; however, \n","valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from \n","knowledge of a particular market. Substantially all of our trading \n","debt securities are recorded using internal trader prices. \n","AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are \n","recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value \n","measurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various \n","sources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices \n","in active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary \n","markets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such \n","securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing \n","services and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from \n","independent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. \n","Substantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using \n","vendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation \n","Processes – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note \n","for additional discussion of our processes when using vendor \n","prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes \n","those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value \n","hierarchy. \n","When vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be \n","adjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also \n","use internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal \n","models use discounted cash flow techniques or market \n","comparable pricing techniques. \n","LOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  LHFS generally includes originated \n","or purchased commercial and residential mortgage loans for sale \n","in the securitization or whole loan market. A significant portion \n","of residential LHFS, and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our \n","trading business, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. \n","The remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written \n","down to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS \n","that are not part of our trading business is based on quoted \n","market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage \n","whole loans with similar characteristics. We may use \n","securitization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization \n","activities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market \n","conditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading \n","business is based on pending transactions when available. Where \n","market pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we \n","use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. \n","LOANS Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record \n","nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that \n","are based on the observable market price of the loan or current \n","appraised value of the collateral less costs to sell. \n","MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs)  Residential MSRs are \n","carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Commercial MSRs are \n","carried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a \n","nonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with \n","readily observable prices. We determine the fair value of MSRs \n","using a valuation model that estimates the present value of \n","expected future net servicing income. The model incorporates \n","assumptions that market participants may use in estimating \n","future net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of \n","prepayment rates (including housing price volatility for \n","residential MSRs), discount rates, and cost to service (including \n","delinquency and foreclosure costs). \n","144 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","DERIVATIVES  Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring \n","basis. Other than certain exchange-traded derivatives that are \n","actively traded and valued using quoted market prices, \n","derivatives are measured using internal valuation techniques. \n","These instruments, which include derivatives traded in over-the-\n","counter (OTC) markets, with clearinghouses, and on exchanges, \n","are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, \n","depending on the significance of unobservable inputs in the \n","valuation. Valuation techniques and inputs to internal models \n","depend on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying \n","rate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is \n","based. Key inputs can include yield curves, credit curves, foreign \n","exchange rates, prepayment rates, volatility measurements and \n","correlation of certain of these inputs. \n","EQUITY SECURITIES  Marketable equity securities and certain \n","nonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account \n","for at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our \n","remaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for \n","using the equity method, cost method or measurement \n","alternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value \n","adjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying \n","value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement \n","alternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence \n","of orderly observable transactions of the same or similar \n","securities of the same issuer. \n","We use quoted prices to determine the fair value of \n","marketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. \n","Quoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable \n","equity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally \n","market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value \n","for such securities. We use all available information in making this \n","determination, which includes observable transaction prices for \n","the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing \n","services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public \n","companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, \n","we make adjustments to observed market data to reflect the \n","comparative differences between the market data and the \n","attributes of our equity security, such as differences with public \n","companies and other investment-specific considerations like \n","liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the \n","instruments. \n","OTHER ASSETS Other assets are generally recorded at amortized \n","cost, with the exception of market risk benefit assets which are \n","recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and valued at the \n","contract level using a discounted cash flow model. For the \n","remaining other assets recorded at amortized cost, we also \n","record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairment \n","or the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject \n","to nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease \n","ROU assets, foreclosed assets and physical commodities. For \n","these assets, fair value is generally based upon independent \n","market prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a \n","discounted cash flow model. \n","Liabilities \n","SHORT-SALE AND OTHER LIABILITIES  Short-sale trading liabilities \n","in our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring \n","basis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, \n","where available. When quoted prices for the same instruments \n","are not available or markets are not active, fair values are \n","estimated using recent trades of similar securities. Other \n","liabilities include market risk benefit liabilities, which are recorded \n","at fair value on a recurring basis and valued at the contract level \n","using a discounted cash flow model. \n","INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND LONG-TERM DEBT  Although \n","interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt are generally \n","recorded at amortized cost, we have elected the fair value option \n","for certain structured notes issued by our trading business. Fair \n","values for these instruments are estimated using a discounted \n","cash flow model that includes both the embedded derivative and \n","debt portions of the notes. The discount rate used in these \n","discounted cash flow models also incorporates the impact of our \n","credit spread, which is generally based on observable spreads in \n","the secondary bond market. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","145 \n","Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes \n","We generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and \n","liabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices \n","obtained from vendors. Our valuation processes vary depending \n","on which approach is utilized. \n","INTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS  Certain Level 3 fair value \n","estimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash \n","flow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the \n","inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable \n","inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic \n","performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in \n","similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be \n","implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to \n","historical experience and other third-party data where available. \n","Internal models are subject to review prescribed within our \n","model risk management policies and procedures, which include \n","model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are \n","appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist \n","to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation \n","assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, \n","including reviewing its key components, such as inputs, \n","processing components, logic or theory, output results and \n","supporting model documentation. Validation also includes \n","ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate \n","given observable market transactions or other market data \n","within the same or similar asset classes. We also have ongoing \n","monitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and \n","liabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, \n","which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models \n","continue to perform as expected, include: \n","• \n","ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions \n","and other independent market data (including pricing \n","vendors, if available); \n","• \n","back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized \n","transactions; and \n","• \n","review of modeled valuation results against expectations, \n","including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in \n","value. \n","We update model inputs and methodologies periodically to \n","reflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing \n","models are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model \n","revalidations as necessary. \n","Internal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by \n","the appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function \n","and monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. \n","Independent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, \n","provides independent oversight of model risk management, and \n","its responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, \n","and monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing \n","periodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk \n","Committee. \n","VENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS  We routinely obtain pricing \n","from third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In \n","certain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities \n","that we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve \n","and periodically review third-party vendors to assess whether \n","information obtained and valuation techniques used are \n","appropriate. This review may consist of, among other things, \n","obtaining and evaluating control reports issued and pricing \n","methodology materials distributed. We monitor and review \n","vendor prices on an ongoing basis to evaluate whether the fair \n","values are reasonable and in line with market experience in \n","similar asset classes. While the inputs used to determine fair \n","value are not provided by the pricing vendors, and therefore \n","unavailable for our review, we perform one or more of the \n","following procedures to validate the pricing information and \n","determine appropriate classification within the fair value \n","hierarchy: \n","• \n","comparison to other pricing vendors (if available); \n","• \n","variance analysis of prices; \n","• \n","corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent \n","market data, such as market transactions and relevant \n","benchmark indices; \n","• \n","review of pricing by Company personnel familiar with market \n","liquidity and other market-related conditions; and \n","• \n","investigation of prices on a specific instrument-by-\n","instrument basis. \n","Note 15:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) \n","146 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a \n","Recurring Basis \n","Table 15.1

Option models \n","estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by \n","incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price \n","of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. \n","The unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are \n","those we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset \n","or liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if \n","by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability \n","would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We \n","also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the \n","instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the \n","significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs \n","used within the valuation. Following is a description of the \n","significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. \n","• \n","Comparability adjustment – is an adjustment made to \n","observed market data, such as a transaction price to reflect \n","dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or other \n","factors used within a market valuation approach, expressed \n","as a percentage of an observed price. \n","• \n","Conversion factor – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a \n","particular instrument may be exchanged for another \n","instrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage \n","change from a specified rate. \n","• \n","Correlation factor – is the likelihood of one instrument \n","changing in price relative to another based on an established \n","relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in \n","price over a period over time. \n","• \n","Cost to service – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a \n","portfolio of loans, which includes estimates for \n","unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and \n","foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing \n","such loan portfolios. \n","• \n","Default rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not \n","collecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a \n","constant default rate (CDR). \n","• \n","Discount rate – is a rate of return used to calculate the \n","present value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at \n","the fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists \n","of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium \n","component. The benchmark rate component, for example, \n","Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or U.S. Treasury \n","rates, is generally observable within the market and is \n","necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money. \n","The risk premium component reflects the amount \n","of compensation market participants require due to the \n","uncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting \n","from risks such as credit and liquidity. \n","• \n","Fall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans \n","associated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio \n","that are likely of not funding. \n","• \n","Initial-value servicing – is the estimated value of the \n","underlying loan, including the value attributable to the \n","embedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of \n","outstanding unpaid principal balance. \n","• \n","Loss severity – is the estimated percentage of contractual \n","cash flows lost in the event of a default. \n","• \n","Multiples – are financial ratios of comparable public \n","companies, such as ratios of enterprise value or market value \n","of equity to earnings before interest, depreciation, and \n","amortization (EBITDA), revenue, net income or book value, \n","adjusted to reflect dissimilarities in operational, financial, or \n","marketability to the comparable public company used in a \n","market valuation approach. \n","• \n","Prepayment rate – is the estimated rate at which forecasted \n","prepayments of principal of the related loan or debt \n","instrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant \n","prepayment rate (CPR). \n","• \n","Volatility factor – is the extent of change in price an item is \n","estimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time \n","expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a \n","period over time. \n","• \n","Weighted average life – is the weighted average number of \n","years an investment is expected to remain outstanding \n","based on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated \n","date the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the \n","instrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing \n","of an instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not \n","contractually fixed. \n","Interrelationships and Uncertainty of Inputs Used in \n","Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements \n","Usage of the valuation techniques presented in Table 15.3 \n","requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some \n","of which represent significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, \n","changes in these unobservable inputs may have a significant \n","impact on fair value. \n","Certain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a \n","directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the \n","instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair \n","value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a \n","given change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used \n","within the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in \n","one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite \n","change in another input having a potentially muted impact to the \n","overall fair value of that particular instrument. Additionally, a \n","change in one unobservable input may result in a change to \n","another unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are \n","interrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify \n","the fair value impact. \n","DEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE  The internal models \n","used to determine fair value for these Level 3 instruments use \n","certain significant unobservable inputs within a discounted cash \n","flow or market comparable pricing valuation technique. Such \n","inputs include discount rate, prepayment rate, default rate, loss \n","severity, multiples, and comparability adjustment. \n","These Level 3 assets would decrease (increase) in value \n","based upon an increase (decrease) in discount rate, default rate \n","or loss severity inputs and would generally decrease (increase) in \n","Note 15:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) \n","150 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","value based upon an increase (decrease) in prepayment rate. \n","Conversely, these Level 3 assets would increase (decrease) in \n","value based upon an increase (decrease) in multiples. The \n","comparability adjustment input may have a positive or negative \n","impact on fair value depending on the change in fair value of the \n","item the comparability adjustment references. \n","Generally, a change in the assumption used for the default \n","rate is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the risk \n","premium component of the discount rate (specifically, the \n","portion related to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change \n","in the assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable \n","inputs for comparability adjustment, multiples, and loss severity \n","do not increase or decrease based on movements in the other \n","significant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 assets. \n","MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS  The discounted cash flow models \n","used to determine fair value of Level 3 residential MSRs utilize \n","certain significant unobservable inputs including prepayment \n","rate, discount rate and costs to service. An increase in any of \n","these unobservable inputs will reduce the fair value of the MSRs \n","and alternatively, a decrease in any one of these inputs would \n","result in the MSRs increasing in value. Generally, a decrease in \n","discount rates increases the value of MSRs, unless accompanied \n","by a related update to our prepayment rates. The cost to service \n","assumption generally does not increase or decrease based on \n","movements in the discount rate or the prepayment rate. The \n","sensitivity to key assumptions of our residential MSRs is \n","discussed further in Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities). \n","DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  Level 3 derivative instruments are \n","valued using market comparable pricing, option pricing and \n","discounted cash flow valuation techniques which use certain \n","unobservable inputs to determine fair value. Such inputs consist \n","of prepayment rate, default rate, loss severity, initial-value \n","servicing, fall-out factor, volatility factor, weighted average life, \n","conversion factor, and correlation factor. \n","Level 3 derivative assets (liabilities) where we are long the \n","underlying would decrease (increase) in value upon an increase \n","(decrease) in default rate, fall-out factor, conversion factor, or \n","loss severity inputs. Conversely, Level 3 derivative assets \n","(liabilities) would generally increase (decrease) in value upon an \n","increase (decrease) in prepayment rate, initial-value servicing, \n","weighted average life or volatility factor inputs. The inverse of \n","the above relationships would occur for instruments when we are \n","short the underlying. The correlation factor input may have a \n","positive or negative impact on the fair value of derivative \n","instruments depending on the change in fair value of the item \n","the correlation factor references. \n","Generally, for derivative instruments for which we are \n","subject to changes in the value of the underlying referenced \n","instrument, a change in the assumption used for default rate is \n","accompanied by directionally similar change in the risk premium \n","component of the discount rate (specifically, the portion related \n","to credit risk) and a directionally opposite change in the \n","assumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable inputs for \n","loss severity, initial-value servicing, fall-out factor, volatility \n","factor, weighted average life, conversion factor, and correlation \n","factor do not increase or decrease based on movements in other \n","significant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 instruments. \n","Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a \n","Nonrecurring Basis \n","We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain \n","assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with \n","GAAP.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \n","transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \n","SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \n","generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \n","may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative \n","transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \n","forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \n","financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \n","connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \n","sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \n","we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \n","right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the \n","transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \n","below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \n","benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans \n","transferred to a VIE by a third party. \n","In connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \n","we have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which \n","may include: \n","• \n","underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently \n","making markets in those securities; \n","• \n","providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs \n","through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \n","• \n","entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \n","• \n","holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \n","• \n","acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \n","• \n","providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \n","• \n","providing seller financing to VIEs. \n","Loan Sales and Securitization Activity \n","We periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and \n","other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan \n","sale transactions. \n","MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \n","ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE  In the normal \n","course of business we sell residential and commercial mortgage \n","loans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are \n","generally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, \n","which provide certain credit guarantees to investors and \n","servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization \n","pools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association \n","(GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing \n","Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of \n","Veterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization \n","with the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The \n","GSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, \n","sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities \n","most significant to the VIE. \n","We account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \n","loan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \n","the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \n","the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \n","VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \n","purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing \n","rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option \n","to repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which \n","becomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when \n","three scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the \n","unilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and \n","a corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our \n","intent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to \n","the securitization. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded \n","assets and related liabilities of $1.0 billion and $743 million, \n","respectively, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase \n","eligible loans. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 \n","and 2021, we repurchased loans of $293 million, $2.2 billion, and \n","$4.6 billion, respectively. \n","Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \n","losses incurred due to material breaches of contractual \n","representations and warranties as well as other recourse \n","arrangements. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our liability for \n","these repurchase and recourse arrangements was $229 million \n","and $167 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to \n","loss was $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, respectively. \n","Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to \n","assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 \n","(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about \n","residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \n","servicing fees. \n","NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  In the \n","normal course of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage \n","loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. \n","Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a \n","government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest \n","holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by \n","the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred \n","loans and account for the transfers as sales. We also typically \n","retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial \n","interests issued by the VIE, such as debt securities held for \n","investment purposes. Our servicing role related to \n","nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is \n","limited to primary or master servicer. We do not consolidate the \n","VIE because the most significant decisions impacting the \n","performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer \n","or the controlling class security holder. For our residential \n","nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as \n","sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider \n","potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a \n","majority of the VIE assets. \n","WHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole loans \n","to VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of \n","financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not \n","consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the \n","most significant activities of the VIEs. \n","Table 16.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \n","the periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as \n","sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred \n","assets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds \n","and recorded servicing assets, securities, and loans. Each of these \n","interests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are \n","classified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are \n","classified as Level 2. The majority of our transfers relate to \n","residential mortgage securitizations with the GSEs or GNMA and \n","generally result in no gain or loss because the loans are measured \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","155 \n","at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, we may transfer \n","certain government insured loans that we previously \n","repurchased. These loans are carried at the lower of cost or \n","market, and we recognize gains on such transfers when the \n","market value is greater than the carrying value of the loan when \n","it is sold. \n","Table 16.1: Transfers with Continuing Involvement \n","Year ended December 31, \n","2023 \n","2022 \n","2021 \n","(in millions) \n","Residential \n","mortgages \n","Commercial \n","mortgages \n","Residential \n","mortgages \n","Commercial \n","mortgages \n","Residential \n","mortgages \n","Commercial \n","mortgages \n","Assets sold \n","$ \n","13,823 \n","8,872 \n","75,582 \n","13,735 \n","157,063 \n","18,247 \n","Proceeds from transfer (1) \n","13,823 \n","9,017 \n","75,634 \n","13,963 \n","157,852 \n","18,563 \n","Net gains (losses) on sale \n","— \n","145 \n","52 \n","228 \n","789 \n","316 \n","Continuing involvement (2): \n","Servicing rights recognized \n","$ \n","157 \n","73 \n","966 \n","128 \n","1,636 \n","166 \n","Securities recognized (3) \n","— \n","94 \n","2,062 \n","189 \n","23,188 \n","173 \n","Loans recognized \n","— \n","— \n","— \n","— \n","926 \n","— \n","(1) \n","Represents cash proceeds and the fair value of non-cash beneficial interests recognized at securitization settlement. \n","(2) \n","Represents assets or liabilities recognized at securitization settlement date related to our continuing involvement in the transferred assets. \n","(3) \n","Represents debt securities obtained at securitization settlement held for investment purposes that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.

Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $7 million and $157 million with related collateral of $27 million and $1.3 billion \n","as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n","Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss \n","that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical \n","circumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, \n","where the value of our interests and any associated collateral \n","declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table \n","17.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to \n","offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee \n","agreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of \n","expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more \n","representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum \n","exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of \n","the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if \n","applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider \n","the credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \n","For our guarantees in Table 17.1, non-investment grade \n","represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of \n","performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is \n","determined based on an external rating or an internal credit \n","grade that is below investment grade, if applicable. \n","STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue standby letters of credit, \n","which include performance and financial guarantees, for \n","customers in connection with contracts between our customers \n","and third parties. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending \n","commitments where we are obligated to make payment to a \n","third party on behalf of a customer if the customer fails to meet \n","their contractual obligations. Total maximum exposure to loss \n","includes the portion of multipurpose lending facilities for which \n","we have issued standby letters of credit under the commitments. \n","DIRECT PAY LETTERS OF CREDIT  We issue direct pay letters of \n","credit to serve as credit enhancements for certain bond \n","issuances. Beneficiaries (bond trustees) may draw upon these \n","instruments to make scheduled principal and interest payments, \n","redeem all outstanding bonds because a default event has \n","occurred, or for other reasons as permitted by the agreement. \n","LOANS AND LHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE  For certain sales and \n","securitizations of loans, predominantly to GSEs, we provide \n","recourse to the buyer for certain losses. Certain arrangements \n","require that we share in the credit risk of the loans, substantially \n","all of which are commercial real estate mortgage loans, where we \n","provide recourse up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-\n","rata basis in the event of borrower default. The maximum \n","exposure to loss represents the outstanding principal balance of \n","the loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse \n","provisions or the maximum losses per the contractual \n","agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the \n","entire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and \n","amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale \n","of collateral. \n","EXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES  We are members \n","of several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing \n","houses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we \n","use to clear our trades and those of our customers, including \n","customers for whom we act as sponsoring member. It is common \n","that all members in these organizations are required to \n","collectively guarantee the performance of other members of the \n","organization. Our obligations under the guarantees are generally \n","a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of \n","the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these \n","organizations. Some membership rules require members to \n","assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another \n","member’s default or from non-member default losses after \n","applying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for \n","these arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 17.1 \n","because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote. In 2023, we \n","began acting as a sponsoring member under the Fixed Income \n","160 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Clearing Corporation’s (FICC) sponsored repo service, where we \n","guarantee the performance of our clients’ obligations to the \n","FICC. We minimize our liability under these guarantees by \n","obtaining a secured interest in the collateral that our clients place \n","with the FICC. \n","OTHER GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS  We have \n","contingent performance arrangements related to various \n","customer relationships and lease transactions. We are required \n","to pay the counterparties to these agreements if third parties \n","default on certain obligations. \n","Under certain factoring arrangements, we may be required \n","to purchase trade receivables from third parties, if receivable \n","debtors default on their payment obligations. \n","We use certain third-party clearing agents to clear and settle \n","transactions on behalf of some of our institutional brokerage \n","customers. We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that \n","could occur for non-performance by our customers on \n","transactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions \n","subject to the indemnifications may include customer obligations \n","related to the settlement of margin accounts and short \n","positions, such as written call options and securities borrowing \n","transactions. \n","We record a liability for mortgage loans that we expect to \n","repurchase pursuant to various representations or warranties. \n","See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for \n","further discussion and related amounts. Additionally, when we \n","sell MSRs, we may provide indemnification for losses incurred \n","due to material breaches of contractual representations or \n","warranties as well as other recourse arrangements. \n","When we sell renewable energy tax credits, we indemnify the \n","buyers for potential future losses incurred due to the \n","disallowance or recapture of the transferred tax credits or \n","material breaches of representations and warranties. Our \n","maximum exposure for these tax credit indemnifications is \n","capped at the amount of the transferred credits. \n","We also enter into other types of indemnification \n","agreements in the ordinary course of business under which we \n","agree to indemnify third parties against any damages, losses and \n","expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings \n","arising from relationships or transactions with us. These \n","relationships or transactions include those arising from service as \n","a director or officer of the Company, underwriting agreements \n","relating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various \n","other business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent \n","of our obligations under these agreements depends entirely \n","upon the occurrence of future events, we are unable to \n","determine our potential future liability under these agreements. \n","WRITTEN OPTIONS  We enter into written foreign currency \n","options and over-the-counter written equity put options that are \n","derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. \n","Written put options give the counterparty the right to sell to us \n","an underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified \n","price by a specified date. While these derivative transactions \n","expose us to risk if the option is exercised, we manage this risk by \n","entering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the \n","underlying instrument. We offset market risk related to options \n","written to customers with cash securities or other offsetting \n","derivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these \n","contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying \n","instrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate \n","obligation under written options is based on future market \n","conditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. The fair value of \n","written options represents our view of the probability that we \n","will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of \n","these written options was an asset of $178 million and a liability \n","of $15 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The \n","fair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on \n","certain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents \n","the notional value of these derivative contracts. At December 31, \n","2023, the maximum exposure to loss was $34.0 billion, with \n","$31.9 billion expiring in three years or less compared with \n","$23.4 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, \n","2022. See Note 14 (Derivatives) for additional information \n","regarding written derivative contracts. \n","MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \n","card transaction processing services through payment networks \n","directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing \n","servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is \n","accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the \n","merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in \n","connection with payment and delivery disputes between the \n","merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the \n","cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. If we are \n","unable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss \n","for the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to \n","make a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant \n","processing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in \n","connection with our merchant processing services because most \n","products and services are delivered when purchased and \n","amounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the \n","merchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with \n","these transactions by withholding future payments and requiring \n","cash or other collateral. We estimate our potential maximum \n","exposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed \n","in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a \n","charge-back transaction. As of December 31, 2023, our potential \n","maximum exposure was approximately $761.9 billion, and \n","related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were \n","insignificant. \n","GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES In the normal course of business, \n","the Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related \n","to its subsidiaries’ obligations. These obligations are included in \n","the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as \n","off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has \n","not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. \n","Additionally, the Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees \n","the payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that \n","may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, \n","Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not \n","guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The \n","guaranteed liabilities were $834 million and $948 million at \n","December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These guarantees \n","rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and \n","unsubordinated indebtedness. \n","The assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its \n","subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity \n","from its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address \n","claims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent \n","under the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of \n","dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If \n","any of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct \n","creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that \n","subsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the \n","Parent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the \n","Parent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary. For additional \n","information regarding other restrictions on the Parent’s ability to \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","161 \n","receive dividends, loan payments and other funds from its \n","subsidiaries, see Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and \n","Other Restrictions). \n","OTHER COMMITMENTS We may enter into commitments to \n","purchase debt and equity securities for various business or \n","investment purposes. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we \n","had commitments to purchase debt securities of $0 and \n","$100 million, respectively, and commitments to purchase equity \n","securities of $9.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. As of \n","December 31, 2023, our commitments to purchase equity \n","securities predominantly included Federal Reserve Bank stock \n","and renewable energy investments. \n","As part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing \n","organizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity \n","to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen \n","events occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these \n","obligations are guarantees of other members’ performance and \n","accordingly are included in Table 17.1 in Other guarantees and \n","indemnifications. \n","We have commitments to enter into resale and securities \n","borrowing agreements as well as repurchase and securities \n","lending agreements with certain counterparties, including central \n","clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded contractual \n","commitments for resale and securities borrowing agreements \n","was $17.5 billion and $19.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, respectively. The amount of our unfunded contractual \n","commitments for repurchase and securities lending agreements \n","was $746 million and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \n","2022, respectively. \n","Given the nature of these commitments, they are excluded \n","from Table 5.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 5 \n","(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses). \n","Note 17:  Guarantees and Other Commitments (continued) \n","162 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","Note 18: Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities \n","We enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities \n","borrowing and lending agreements (collectively, “securities \n","financing activities”) typically to finance trading positions \n","(including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to cover \n","short trading positions, accommodate customers’ financing \n","needs, and settle other securities obligations. These activities are \n","conducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser \n","extent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing \n","activities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as \n","U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, \n","to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity \n","securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We \n","account for these transactions as collateralized financings in \n","which we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We \n","believe these financing transactions generally do not have \n","material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related \n","monitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements \n","involving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of \n","our commercial lending business activities. \n","OFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED \n","FINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 18.1 presents resale and repurchase \n","agreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) \n","and securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to \n","master securities lending agreements (MSLA). Where legally \n","enforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, \n","in the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities \n","held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the \n","same counterparty. Collateralized financings with the same \n","counterparty are presented net on our consolidated balance \n","sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit balance sheet \n","netting. The majority of transactions subject to these \n","agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not eligible \n","for balance sheet netting. \n","Collateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, \n","such as securities or loans, and is not netted on our consolidated \n","balance sheet against the related liability. Collateral we received \n","includes securities or loans and is not recognized on our \n","consolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may \n","be increased or decreased over time to maintain certain \n","contractual thresholds, as the assets underlying each \n","arrangement fluctuate in value. For additional information on \n","collateral pledged and accepted, see Note 19 (Pledged Assets \n","and Collateral). Generally, these agreements require collateral to \n","exceed the asset or liability recognized on the balance sheet. The \n","following table includes the amount of collateral pledged or \n","received related to exposures subject to enforceable MRAs or \n","MSLAs. While these agreements are typically over-collateralized, \n","the disclosure in this table is limited to the reported amount of \n","such collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset or \n","liability for each counterparty. \n","In addition to the amounts included in Table 18.1, we also \n","have balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is disclosed \n","in Note 14 (Derivatives). \n","Table 18.1: Offsetting – Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities \n","(in millions) \n","Dec 31, \n","2023 \n","Dec 31, \n","2022 \n","Assets: \n","Resale and securities borrowing agreements \n","Gross amounts recognized \n","$ \n","129,282 \n","114,729 \n","Gross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) \n","(28,402) \n","(24,464) \n","Net amounts in consolidated balance sheet (2) \n","100,880 \n","90,265 \n","Collateral received not recognized in consolidated balance sheet (3) \n","(99,970) \n","(89,592) \n","Net amount (4) \n","$ \n","910 \n","673 \n","Liabilities: \n","Repurchase and securities lending agreements \n","Gross amounts recognized \n","$ \n","106,060 \n","55,054 \n","Gross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) \n","(28,402) \n","(24,464) \n","Net amounts in consolidated balance sheet (5) \n","77,658 \n","30,590 \n","Collateral pledged but not netted in consolidated balance sheet (6) \n","(77,529) \n","(30,383) \n","Net amount (4) \n","$ \n","129 \n","207 \n","(1) \n","Represents recognized amount of resale and repurchase agreements with counterparties subject  to enforceable MRAs that have been offset within our consolidated balance sheet. \n","(2) \n","Includes $80.4 billion and $68.0 billion classified on our consolidated balance sheet in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements at December 31, 2023 and 2022, \n","respectively.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange \n","for transferring securities as collateral and recognize an \n","obligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction’s \n","maturity. These types of transactions create risks, including \n","(1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, \n","(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below \n","the amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and \n","therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional \n","amounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity \n","on demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to \n","contractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in \n","various ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid \n","securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial \n","strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of \n","collateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase \n","amounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned \n","through the clearing and settlement process in advance of our \n","cash repayment.

Account charges include fees for periodic account \n","maintenance activities and event-driven services such as stop \n","payment fees.

Our obligation for overdraft services is \n","satisfied at the time of the overdraft.

Wire transfer \n","and other remittance fees consist of fees earned for providing \n","funds transfer services and issuing cashier’s checks and money \n","orders. Our obligation is satisfied at the time of the performance \n","of the funds transfer service or upon issuance of the cashier’s \n","check or money order.

These fees were impacted by the sales of our Corporate \n","Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management, \n","which closed in fourth quarter 2021. \n","Fees from advisory account relationships with brokerage \n","customers are charged based on a percentage of the market \n","value of the client’s assets.

However, these \n","fees are received and recognized over time during the period the \n","customer owns the shares and we remain the broker of record. \n","The amount of trailing commissions is variable based on the \n","length of time the customer holds the shares and on changes in \n","the value of the underlying assets. \n","Asset management services include managing and \n","administering assets, including mutual funds, and institutional \n","separate accounts. Fees for these services are generally \n","determined based on a tiered scale relative to the market value \n","of assets under management (AUM). In addition to AUM, we \n","have client assets under administration (AUA) that earn various \n","administrative fees which are generally based on the extent of \n","the services provided to administer the account. Services with \n","AUM and AUA-based fees are generally satisfied over time. \n","Trust services include acting as a trustee or agent for \n","personal trust and agency assets. Obligations for trust services \n","are generally satisfied over time; however, obligations for \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","169 \n","activities that are transitional in nature are satisfied at the time \n","of the transaction. \n","COMMISSIONS AND BROKERAGE SERVICES FEES are earned for \n","providing brokerage services. \n","Commissions from transactional accounts with brokerage \n","customers are earned for executing transactions at the client’s \n","direction.

Our obligation is satisfied at the time we \n","provide the service which is generally at the time of the \n","transaction. \n","INVESTMENT BANKING FEES are earned for underwriting debt and \n","equity securities, arranging syndicated loan transactions and \n","performing other advisory services. Our obligation for these \n","services is generally satisfied at closing of the transaction. \n","CARD FEES include credit and debit card interchange and network \n","revenue and various card-related fees.

Upon the FDIC’s finalization of the rule, we \n","expensed the entire estimated amount of our special assessment \n","of $1.9 billion (pre-tax), which will be paid over eight quarters \n","beginning in June 2024.

For the \n","nonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, \n","there is no minimum required contribution beyond the amount \n","needed to fund benefit payments. \n","We recognize settlement losses for our Cash Balance Plan \n","based on an assessment of whether lump sum benefit payments \n","will, in aggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its annual \n","service and interest cost (threshold). Settlement losses of \n","$221 million were recognized during 2022, representing the pro \n","rata portion of the net loss in accumulated other comprehensive \n","income (AOCI) based on the percentage reduction in the Cash \n","Balance Plan’s projected benefit obligation attributable to 2022 \n","lump sum payments (included in the “Benefits paid” line in Table \n","22.1).

Following is a description of the \n","valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. \n","Cash and Cash Equivalents – includes investments in \n","collective investment funds valued at fair value based upon the \n","fund’s NAV per share held at year end. The NAV per share is \n","quoted on a private market that is not active; however, the NAV \n","per share is based on underlying investments traded on an active \n","market. This group of assets also includes investments in \n","registered investment companies valued at the NAV per share \n","held at year end and in interest-bearing bank accounts. \n","Long Duration, Intermediate (Core), High-Yield, and \n","International Fixed Income – includes investments traded on the \n","secondary markets; prices are measured by using quoted market \n","prices for similar securities, pricing models, and discounted cash \n","flow analyses using significant inputs observable in the market \n","where available, or a combination of multiple valuation \n","techniques. This group of assets also includes highly liquid \n","government securities such as U.S. Treasuries, limited \n","partnerships valued at the NAV, registered investment \n","companies, and collective investment funds described above. \n","Domestic, Global, International and Emerging Market Stocks – \n","investments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at \n","quoted market values. This group of assets also includes \n","investments in registered investment companies and collective \n","investment funds described above. \n","Real Estate –includes investments in exchange-traded equity \n","securities, and registered investment companies described \n","above. \n","Hedge Funds / Absolute Return – includes investments in \n","collective investment funds as described above. \n","Other – insurance contracts that are stated at cash surrender \n","value. This group of assets also includes investments in \n","registered investment companies and collective investment \n","funds described above. \n","The methods described above may produce a fair value \n","calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or \n","reflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation \n","methods are appropriate and consistent with other market \n","participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions \n","to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could \n","result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. \n","Defined Contribution Retirement Plans \n","We sponsor a qualified defined contribution retirement plan, the \n","Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan). Under the \n","401(k) Plan, after 1 month of service, eligible employees may \n","contribute up to 50% of their certified compensation, subject to \n","statutory limits. \n","With some exceptions, employees with one year of service \n","who are employed in a benefit-eligible position on December 15 \n","are eligible to receive matching contributions, which are dollar for \n","dollar up to 6% of certified compensation. The 401(k) Plan also \n","includes a non-discretionary base contribution of 1% of certified \n","compensation for employees with annual compensation of less \n","than $75,000. Eligible employees are 100% vested in their \n","matching contributions and base contributions after three years \n","of service. Base and matching contributions are made annually at \n","year end.

Our responsibility is to express an \n","opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and \n","are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \n","and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \n","obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \n","error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial \n","statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, \n","on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included \n","evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation \n","of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n","Critical Audit Matters \n","The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \n","statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or \n","disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex \n","judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, \n","taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit \n","matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \n","Assessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans (ACL) \n","As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s ACL as of December 31, 2023 was \n","$15.1 billion. The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk \n","characteristics and on an individual basis for those loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. The Company estimated the \n","ACL for collectively evaluated commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected \n","exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived utilizing credit loss models \n","based on historical observations of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for \n","collectively evaluated consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which estimate expected credit losses in the portfolio based on \n","historical experience of probability of default and severity of loss estimates. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic \n","variables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts \n","multiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to estimate expected credit losses. After the \n","reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the \n","forecasted economic variables based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. The Company estimated the ACL for \n","individually evaluated commercial loans using discounted cash flow (DCF) or fair value of collateral methods. A portion of the ACL is \n","comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. \n","We identified the assessment of the ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and \n","knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment \n","encompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to \n","estimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable \n","forecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for \n","qualitative factors that may not be adequately captured in the loss models. The assessment included an evaluation of the \n","186 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","conceptual soundness and performance of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models. The assessment also encompassed \n","the evaluation of the DCF and fair value of collateral methods and assumptions used to estimate the ACL for individually evaluated \n","commercial real estate (CRE) loans. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence \n","obtained. \n","The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. \n","We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of the ACL \n","estimate, including controls over the: \n","• \n","development of certain credit loss models \n","• \n","continued use and appropriateness of changes made to certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \n","• \n","performance monitoring of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \n","• \n","identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \n","• \n","development of the qualitative factors, including significant assumptions used in the measurement of certain qualitative \n","factors \n","• \n","evaluation of the DCF and fair value of collateral assessments used to determine the expected credit losses for individually \n","evaluated CRE loans \n","• \n","analysis of the ACL results, trends, and ratios. \n","We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the estimate by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the Company \n","used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals \n","with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \n","• \n","evaluating the Company’s ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \n","• \n","evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development, assessment and performance testing of certain \n","credit loss models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and \n","regulatory practices \n","• \n","assessing the conceptual soundness of the credit loss models, including the selection of certain assumptions, by inspecting the \n","model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use \n","• \n","evaluating the methodology used to develop the forecasted economic scenarios, the selection of underlying assumptions and \n","the weighting of scenarios by comparing them to the Company’s business environment \n","• \n","assessing the forecasted economic scenarios through comparison to publicly available forecasts \n","• \n","testing the historical observation period and reasonable and supportable forecast periods to evaluate the length of each period \n","• \n","testing individual credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, \n","sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral \n","• \n","evaluating the methods and assumptions used to develop certain qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the ACL \n","compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying \n","quantitative models \n","• \n","evaluating the methods and assumptions used by the Company in the DCF and fair value of collateral assessments for \n","individually evaluated CRE loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any \n","relevant guarantees or underlying collateral. \n","We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the ACL estimate by evaluating the: \n","• \n","cumulative results of the audit procedures \n","• \n","qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices \n","• \n","potential bias in the accounting estimates. \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","187 \n","Assessment of the residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \n","As discussed in Notes 1, 6, 15, and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s residential MSR asset as of \n","December 31, 2023 was $7.5 billion on an underlying loan servicing portfolio of $560 billion. The Company recognizes MSRs when it \n","retains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third \n","parties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a \n","valuation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, \n","which incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These \n","assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service \n","(including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late \n","fees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. \n","We identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including \n","specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs. \n","Specifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity used to evaluate the valuation model and the following assumptions because \n","they are unobservable and the sensitivity of changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the valuation (1) prepayment \n","rates, (2) discount rates, and (3) cost to service. There was also a high degree of subjectivity and potential for management bias \n","related to updates made to significant assumptions due to changes in market conditions, mortgage interest rates, or servicing \n","standards. \n","The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested \n","the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the assessment of residential MSRs, including controls over the: \n","• \n","assessment of the valuation model \n","• \n","evaluation of the significant assumptions (prepayment rates, discount rates, and cost to service) used in determining the MSR \n","fair value \n","• \n","comparison of the MSR fair value to independent appraisals. \n","We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the MSR fair value by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the \n","Company used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved valuation \n","professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \n","• \n","evaluating the design of the valuation model used to estimate the MSR fair value in accordance with relevant U.S. generally \n","accepted accounting principles \n","• \n","evaluating significant assumptions based on an analysis of backtesting results and a comparison of significant assumptions to \n","available data for comparable entities and independent appraisals \n","• \n","assessing significant assumption updates made during the year by considering backtesting results, market events, independent \n","appraisals, and other circumstances that a market participant would have expected to be incorporated in the valuation that \n","were not incorporated. \n","Assessment of goodwill impairment \n","As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance as of December 31, 2023 \n","was $25.2 billion. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or \n","circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its \n","carrying amount, including goodwill. Management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using both an income approach and \n","a market approach. The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis that incorporates assumptions including financial \n","forecasts, a terminal value based on an assumed long-term growth rate, and a discount rate. The financial forecasts include future \n","expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and considerations related to future business activities. The \n","forecasted cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from a capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of \n","equity to the reporting unit. The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies and \n","incorporates assumptions including the selection of comparable companies and a control premium representative of management’s \n","expectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. \n","We identified the assessment of goodwill impairment for the Consumer Lending reporting unit, which had $7.1 billion of allocated \n","goodwill as of December 31, 2023, as a critical audit matter.A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, \n","and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the \n","evaluation of certain assumptions used in the DCF analysis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, including (1) the future \n","expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast and (2) the discount rate. \n","188 \n","Wells Fargo & Company \n","The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested \n","the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s determination of the estimated fair value of the \n","Consumer Lending reporting unit, including controls related to the: \n","• \n","evaluation of the future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast assumption \n","and \n","• \n","evaluation of the discount rate assumption. \n","We evaluated the reasonableness of the financial forecast assumption for the reporting unit by evaluating historical performance \n","and economic trends. We also evaluated the consistency of the financial forecast assumption by comparing the forecast to other \n","analyses used by the Company and inquiries performed of senior management regarding the strategic plans for the reporting unit, \n","including future expectations of balance sheet changes and business activities. We compared historical financial forecasts to actual \n","results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills \n","and knowledge, who assisted in: \n","• \n","evaluating the reasonableness of the financial forecast assumption for the reporting unit by comparing certain growth trends \n","for the reporting unit to publicly available data for comparable entities \n","• \n","evaluating the discount rate assumption used in the fair value determination by comparing the inputs to the discount rate to \n","publicly available data for comparable entities and assessing the resulting discount rate and \n","• \n","evaluating the reasonableness of the total fair value through comparison to the Company’s market capitalization and analysis \n","of the resulting premium to applicable market transactions. \n","We have served as

So far the result has been a slowing economy in an orderly \\nfashion, and the risks of a meaningful recession are diminishing. \\nWe took several proactive steps to prepare for the uncertain economic outcome.

This is important not only from a risk-management standpoint; it also \\nhelps us do the right thing for our customers by extending credit based on conservative underwriting standards.

Banks such as ours \\nhave large securities portfolios driven by the fact that we have more deposits than loans. We invest some of the difference in', 'securities and earn a market yield.  This portfolio, combined with the other assets and liabilities we hold, creates risk that should \\nbe managed very carefully. We invested prudently when yields were low. By doing this, we forwent additional net interest income \\nin the short term, but we avoided outsized losses in our securities portfolio as rates rose. Ultimately, we have started to invest at \\nhigher rates.', 'higher rates.  \\nManaging this trade-off is critical for banks as we rely on the confidence of both our customers and the markets to operate. \\nManaging our liquidity and capital is extremely important to supporting that confidence.

Our management team is extremely capable', 'and has proven their capabilities over the past several years. The work we have done together has bolstered our position even \\nmore.  \\nWe believe our business model provides unique benefits that allow us to serve customers, communities and the broader economy \\nin important and differentiated ways. We are predominantly a U.S. bank, and we have scale and diversification across the country.', 'We serve a broad range of customers, from large to small and across numerous industries and wealth segments. We have a \\ndiversified set of risks that we actively manage, and we seek to avoid concentrations that could be outsized for our company. Our \\nfunding sources are diversified, we have a strong capital base, and as one of eight Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) in \\nthe U.S., we operate with heightened regulation and supervision. This enhances our strength.', 'When there are disruptive events, the benefits of our business model become even clearer. In the first quarter of 2023, we were \\nable to support the U.S. financial system, along with ten other large banks, by utilizing our strength and liquidity to make a $5 \\nbillion uninsured deposit into First Republic. This deposit helped First Republic provide liquidity to its customers and calm the \\nmarkets for a period of time.', 'markets for a period of time.  \\nWe were well prepared for this scenario and were viewed as a safe institution to serve customers during this period.

We are executing on our risk and control work, we have', 'reoriented our business priorities, we have changed how we manage the company, and we have improved how we work across our \\nbusiness. \\n2023 was an important year in our transformation. When I began as CEO of Wells Fargo in 2019, we set out a series of strategic \\npriorities, and in 2023 we continued to execute them. \\nRisk and control \\nI have been clear since I joined the company that closing gaps in Wells Fargo’s risk and control environment is our top priority.', 'Simply stated, the objective is to build a risk and control infrastructure that is appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity, \\nmaking our operational and compliance risk management as robust as our credit and other financial risk management has \\nhistorically been. \\nTo get this work done, we have developed plans and have been executing them now for several years. We are completing these', 'plans with increasing confidence. We have detailed project plans that track interim deliverables, not just the dates when the work \\nis to be finalized and turned over to our regulators for validation. As we have completed these interim deliverables, our control \\nenvironment has become increasingly stronger. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous, ongoing effort, and as we', 'implement changes, we track effectiveness along the way. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly \\nimproving our control environment – but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. \\nWe are making progress because we are managing this work differently than we did historically.  We have prioritized it as the \\nmost important body of work we have to accomplish at the company. We have much more effective reporting and processes in', 'place to provide appropriate oversight. We have added approximately 10,000 people across numerous risk- and control-related \\ngroups and spent over $2.5 billion more in 2023 than in 2018 in these areas. Critical to our progress is the experienced people we \\nnow have at the company who have the skills and commitment to complete this work.  \\nIn February 2024, we reached an important milestone when the OCC announced the termination of a consent order it issued in', '2016 regarding sales practices misconduct at the company. Since the order was put in place in 2016, we have revamped how we \\noffer and sell products and services and we have taken additional actions to protect our customers and employees. \\nThe closure of this order is an important step forward and is a demonstration of what I wrote above: we have prioritized risk- and', 'control-related work, we have put substantial resources behind it, and we are seeing results. The OCC’s action is confirmation that \\nwe operate much differently today around sales practices, and it is the sixth enforcement action against Wells Fargo that our \\nregulators have closed since 2019. \\nThis is not to say that we are done. We remain focused on the work ahead and, again, we are moving forward with confidence. At', 'the same time, I will repeat what I’ve said in the past. Regulatory pressure on banks with longstanding issues such as ours is high \\nand until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. \\nAdditionally, as we implement heightened controls and oversight, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these \\nmay result in additional regulatory actions.', 'may result in additional regulatory actions. \\nReorienting our business mix and building higher returns through cycles \\nWe continue to look at our business mix and react to changes in regulations, market dynamics and the external environment to \\nput us in a strong position to serve our customers.  We are also working more closely across the company’s business units and \\nfunctions than ever before. \\nRepositioning Home Lending', 'Repositioning Home Lending \\nOver the past year, we have implemented a meaningfully different Home Lending business model than we had been \\noperating for decades. We made the decision to significantly downsize the business and focus on serving customers who \\nhave a broader relationship with Wells Fargo, while continuing to provide support for underserved communities. \\nIn some ways this decision was hard; in other ways it was easy. Having a large home lending platform had been an', 'important part of what defined Wells Fargo for a long time. We prided ourselves on helping build home ownership across \\nthe United States. And for many years, the origination revenues generally increased when rates decreased, providing \\nmuch-needed diversification from many of the company’s other businesses, which generally earned less in lower-rate \\nenvironments. \\niv\\nOur decision reflects our belief that much has changed regarding regulation, capital requirements, and reputational risk', 'for large banks who operate large home lending businesses, as well as the different standards in this space for smaller \\nbanks and non-banks. Simply put, we do not believe the risk-adjusted returns and the reputation risk we bear are \\nattractive to operate the business at the scale we did previously.  \\nWe still view home lending as an important product to offer our customers and we will continue to support their needs. \\nWe can do this with a smaller business than we have had in the past.', 'Since we announced this change, we have exited the correspondent lending business and reduced the size of our sales \\nforce. Since 2019, Wells Fargo’s home lending originations have decreased from $204 billion to $25 billion, and the \\namount of mortgage loans we service for third parties declined by over 45%. \\nOther business simplification \\nIn addition to executing on our more focused home lending strategy, we continue to look at other activities with an aim', 'toward simplifying the company. To that end, we sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain \\nNorwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds in 2023. \\nOur actions in 2023 to simplify the company build on other actions we took between 2019-2022. These include the \\nfollowing: \\n• \\nSold Wells Fargo Asset Management \\n• \\nSold our Corporate Trust Services business \\n• \\nSold our student lending portfolio and stopped the origination of new student loans \\n•', '• \\nExited our international wealth management segment \\n• \\nSold our Canadian direct equipment finance business \\n• \\nExited the direct Auto business \\n• \\nStopped originating personal lines of credit \\n• \\nSold our Institutional Retirement and Trust business \\n• \\nIn addition, over the past several years, we have closed over a dozen representative offices globally to better \\nfocus our international business, including offices in Asia, Europe, South America, the Middle East, and \\nelsewhere.', 'elsewhere. \\nInvesting in our core businesses to better serve customers \\nWe are investing more aggressively than in the past in parts of our business to better serve our customers and we \\nbelieve these will help produce higher risk adjusted returns over economic cycles. \\nCredit Card \\nWe continue to believe that a broader credit card platform is important strategically for the company. Providing', 'credit for our customers is a core strategy for us, but being involved in payments has grown in importance. Though \\nour card business is smaller than some of our competitors, it operates with necessary scale and we have been \\nworking to introduce attractive new products over the last few years. These include Active Cash®, which offers \\ncustomers 2% cash rewards on purchases with no limits and no annual fees; Autograph℠, which offers three-times', 'points on certain purchases; Reflect®, which offers 0% intro APR for 21 months; and, most recently, new co-branded \\ncards with Choice Hotels. \\nIn total, spend on our cards grew by 15% between 2022-2023, significantly more than the industry average; our \\ncredit card balances grew 13%; and credit quality remains within our expectations.  \\nThese products have been well received in the marketplace because they offer clear and simple customer value', 'propositions. That’s something we’ll continue to focus on as we build our Cards business, while we also work to \\nimprove our fraud capabilities, line assignments, and customer service. \\nI’m proud of the progress we’ve made and am excited about what is still to come.  \\n  2023 Annual Report      v \\nCorporate and Investment Bank \\nWe are investing to build our fee-based businesses in our Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB). While historically', 'many outside of Wells Fargo have not perceived us as a bank that serves large corporate clients, in fact we have \\nrelationships with approximately three-quarters of the Fortune 500.

When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company. See the “Glossary of Acronyms” for definitions of terms used \\nthroughout this Report.\\xa0\\nFinancial Review \\nOverview \\nWells\\xa0Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company \\nthat has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets. We provide a', 'diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products \\nand services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, \\nthrough our four reportable operating segments: Consumer \\nBanking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and \\nInvestment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. \\nWells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune’s\\xa02023 rankings of \\nAmerica’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and \\nthird in the market value of our common stock among all U.S.', 'banks at December\\xa031, 2023. \\nWells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \\nCompany is subject to a number of consent orders and other \\nregulatory actions, some of which are described below. These \\nregulatory actions may require the Company, among other \\nthings, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, \\nproducts and services, and risk management practices.', 'Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple \\nyears, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays \\nalong the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely \\nto continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and \\ncontrol infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory \\nactions. Regulators have indicated the potential for escalating \\nconsequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues or', 'have repeat issues. Furthermore, issues or delays with one \\nregulatory action could affect our progress on others. Failure to \\nsatisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis \\ncould result in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, \\nlimitations on subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or \\nliquidity requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse \\nconsequences, which could be significant. While we still have', 'significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects \\nof these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to \\ndevoting the resources necessary to operate with strong \\nbusiness practices and controls, maintain the highest level of \\nintegrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. \\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \\nGovernance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \\nRisk Management \\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order', 'with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \\n(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of \\nDirectors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \\nthe Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the \\nCompany submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the \\nCompany’s compliance and operational risk management \\nprogram. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the \\nCompany works to address the consent order provisions. The', 'consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s \\nacceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s \\nadoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \\nthird-party review of the enhancements and improvements \\nprovided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \\nand the plans are adopted and implemented to the satisfaction \\nof the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined \\nunder the consent order will be limited to the level as of', 'December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured \\non a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of \\ntemporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second \\nthird-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy \\nand sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection \\nBureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \\nRegarding Compliance Risk Management Program,', 'Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, \\nAutomobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and \\nMortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders \\nwith the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the \\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an \\naggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters \\nregarding the Company’s compliance risk management program', 'and past practices involving certain automobile collateral \\nprotection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate \\nlock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company \\nsubmitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance \\nrisk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s \\ninternal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial \\nlaw and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required \\nby the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-', 'objection plans to remediate customers affected by the \\nautomobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage \\ninterest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management \\nof remediation activities conducted by the Company. The \\nCompany continues to work to address the provisions of the \\nconsent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a \\n$250\\xa0million civil money penalty against the Company related to \\ninsufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s', 'April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the \\nCompany’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the \\nCFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would \\nterminate. \\n2 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nConsent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation \\nActivities \\nOn September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent \\norder with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the \\nexecution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation', 'activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent \\norder restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party \\nresidential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain \\nmortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the \\nCompany’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is \\nprovided. \\nConsent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile \\nLending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage \\nLending \\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent', 'order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer \\nremediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, \\nconsumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain \\npractices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive \\nrefunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile \\nprotection agreements; comply with certain business practice \\nrequirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a', '$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related \\nto many of these matters were already substantially complete at \\nthe time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \\norder lays out a path to termination after the Company \\ncompletes the remainder of the required actions. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \\nthe OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and', 'entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \\nin connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \\nreceived products and services they did not request. As a result, it \\nremains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \\naction plan that includes making things right for our customers, \\nemployees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \\nCompany for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB', 'consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. On \\nFebruary 15, 2024, the OCC announced the termination of its \\nconsent order regarding retail sales practices. \\nCustomer Remediation Activities \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \\nareas or instances where customers may have experienced \\nfinancial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \\nimplement additional operational and control procedures. We are', 'working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. \\nWe have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \\nrelated to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \\nmay change based on additional facts and information, as well as \\nongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. We \\nhad $819 million and $2.3 billion of accrued liabilities for \\ncustomer remediation activities as of December\\xa031, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we', 'continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we \\nhave identified and may in the future identify additional items or \\nareas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we \\nwill continue to assess any customer harm and provide \\nremediation as appropriate. \\nRecent Developments \\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment \\nIn November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \\n(FDIC) finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit', 'insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of 2023. \\nUnder the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based \\non a calculation using an insured depository institution’s (IDI) \\nestimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC’s \\nfinalization of the rule, we expensed the entire estimated amount \\nof our special assessment of $1.9 billion (pre-tax), which will be \\npaid over eight quarters beginning in June\\xa02024. The amount of', 'our special assessment may change as the FDIC determines the \\nactual losses to the deposit insurance fund and evaluates any \\namendments by IDIs to uninsured deposit amounts reported for \\nDecember 31, 2022. \\nOverdraft Fees Proposal \\nOn January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would \\nlimit overdraft fees charged by certain banks. We expect a \\nsignificant reduction to our overdraft fees, which are included in \\ndeposit-related fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed.', 'Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal \\nOn October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would \\nreduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by \\ndebit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for \\nan update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year \\nbased on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card \\nissuers. We expect a significant reduction to our debit card \\ninterchange fees, which are included in card fees, if the rule is', 'adopted as currently proposed. \\nCapital Matters \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n3 \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed \\nrule to implement the final components of Basel III, which would \\nimpact risk-based capital requirements for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular', 'risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed \\nrule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to', 'address the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet \\nand capital optimization strategies. \\nFor additional information about capital planning, see the \\n“Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” \\nsection in this Report. \\nFinancial Performance \\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \\nIn first quarter 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards \\nBoard (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – \\nFinancial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted', 'Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. \\nWe adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which \\nrequired revision of prior period financial statements.

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. For additional \\ninformation, see Table 8. We define our reportable operating \\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their \\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The', 'management reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to', 'consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nFunds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in', 'net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nRevenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another', 'line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. We periodically assess and update our revenue \\nand expense allocation methodologies. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-', 'income housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s \\nconsolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based', 'on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \\nperiodically assessed and updated. Effective January\\xa01, 2023, \\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\nregulatory constraints of the Company.

Risk is the possibility of an \\nevent occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability \\nto achieve its strategic and business objectives. The Company \\nroutinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its \\ncustomers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest \\nrate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, \\nsuch as operational (which includes compliance and model risks),', 'strategic and reputation risks. \\nRisk Profile.  The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the \\naggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and \\nbusiness activities after taking into consideration risk \\nmanagement effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk \\nprofile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. \\nRisk Capacity.  Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that \\nthe Company could assume given its current level of resources', 'before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital \\nand liquidity needs. \\nRisk Appetite.  Risk appetite is the nature and level of risk the \\nCompany is willing to take, within its risk capacity, while pursuing \\nits strategic and business objectives. Risk appetite is articulated \\nin our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable \\nrisks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The \\nCompany’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior', 'management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps \\nguide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company \\ncontinuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews \\nreports which include risk appetite information and analysis. \\nRisk and Strategy.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the \\nCompany’s strategic planning process, which identifies the \\nCompany’s most significant opportunities and challenges, \\ndevelops plans to address them, evaluates the risks of those', 'plans, and articulates the resulting decisions in the form of a \\ncompany-wide strategic plan. The Company’s risk profile, risk \\ncapacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are \\nconsidered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with \\nthe Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s \\nIndependent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates \\nin strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent', 'assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM \\nalso independently assesses and challenges the impact of the \\nstrategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk \\nmanagement effectiveness at the principal lines of business, \\nenterprise functions, and aggregate Company levels. The \\nstrategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s \\nevaluation. \\nRisk and Climate Change.  The Company views climate change as', 'a global challenge that presents significant impacts for \\nbusinesses and communities around the world. The Company \\nexpects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk \\ntypes it manages, and the Company continues to integrate \\nclimate considerations into its risk management framework as its \\nunderstanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. \\nRisk is Managed by Everyone.  Every employee, in the course of', 'their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing \\nrisk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, \\nincluding establishing and maintaining the Company’s risk and \\ncontrol environment. Every employee must comply with \\napplicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \\nRisk and Culture.  Senior management sets the tone at the top \\nby supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \\nexpectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees', 'conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board is \\nresponsible for holding senior management accountable for \\nestablishing and maintaining this culture and effectively \\nmanaging risk. Senior management expects employees to speak \\nup when they see something that could cause harm to the \\nCompany’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, \\nor reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s \\nresponsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to', 'challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their \\nconcerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s \\nperformance management and incentive compensation \\nprograms are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk \\nand reward under core principles that employees are expected to \\nknow and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources \\nCommittee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing \\ncredible challenge to the Company’s performance management', 'and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk \\nmanagement is a central component of employee performance \\nevaluations. \\nRisk Management Framework.  The Company’s risk \\nmanagement framework sets forth the Company’s core \\nprinciples for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by \\nthe Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. \\nMany other documents and policies flow from its core principles. \\nWells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by', 'building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure.

The Board oversees the Company’s business, \\nincluding its risk management. It assesses senior management’s \\nperformance and holds senior management accountable for', 'maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management \\nprogram. \\nBoard Committee Structure.  The Board carries out its risk \\noversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. \\nThe Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk \\nmanagement framework and oversees management’s \\nimplementation of the framework, including how the Company \\nmanages and governs risk.

As master servicer, our primary duties are \\ntypically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of', 'the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent \\namounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform \\ntheir advancing obligations. The amount and timing of \\nreimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by \\ninvestor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for additional information about residential and \\ncommercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees.', 'In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \\ntransfer as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from \\ncertain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable \\nbased on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan \\npayments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to \\nrepurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding \\nliability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to', 'repurchase the loan.

These committees oversee the \\nadministration and effectiveness of financial risk management \\npolicies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. \\nAt the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability', 'Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management \\nfrom finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and \\nsupports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance \\nCommittee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in \\nmore detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate \\nmanagement level oversight specific to market risk. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is the risk that market \\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange', 'can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming \\nfrom mismatches in the cash flows of the Company’s assets and \\nliabilities generally arising from customer-related lending and \\ndeposit-taking activities. We are subject to interest rate risk \\nbecause: \\n• \\nassets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times \\nor by different amounts; \\n• \\nshort-term and long-term market interest rates may change \\nindependently or with different magnitudes; \\n•', 'independently or with different magnitudes; \\n• \\nthe remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \\nshorten or lengthen as interest rates change; or \\n• \\ninterest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on \\nloan demand, collateral values, credit losses, loan origination \\nvolume, and the fair value of financial instruments and \\nMSRs. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing the earnings \\noutcomes from multiple interest rate scenarios that differ in the', 'direction of interest rate changes, the degree and speed of \\ninterest rate changes over time, and the projected shape of the \\nyield curve. These scenarios require assumptions regarding \\ndrivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan \\noriginations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, \\ndeposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. We \\nperiodically assess and enhance our scenarios and assumptions. \\nOur scenario assumptions reflected the following: \\n•', '• \\nScenarios are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our \\nassets and liabilities over time. \\n• \\nMortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \\nlower interest rates. \\n• \\nOther macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \\nwith the changes in interest rates are held constant. \\n• \\nThe funding forecast in our base scenario incorporates \\ndeposit mix changes and market funding levels consistent', 'with the base interest rate trajectory. Our hypothetical \\nscenarios incorporate deposit mix that is the same as in the \\nbase scenario. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer \\ndeposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding \\nproducts and/or requires additional market funding could \\nreduce the expected benefit from higher rates. \\n• \\nThe interest rate sensitivity of deposits as market interest \\nrates change, referred to as deposit betas, are informed by', 'historical behavior and expectations for near-term pricing \\nstrategies. Our actual experience may differ from \\nexpectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit \\nrepricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. \\nTable 30 presents the results of the estimated net interest \\nincome sensitivity over the next 12 months from the multiple \\nscenarios compared with our base scenario. The base scenario is a \\nreference point used by the Company for financial planning', 'purposes. These hypothetical scenarios include instantaneous \\nmovements across the yield curve with both lower and higher \\ninterest rates under a parallel shift, as well as steeper and flatter \\nnon-parallel changes in the yield curve. Long-term interest rates \\nare defined as all tenors three years and longer, and short-term \\ninterest rates are defined as all tenors less than three years. \\nTable 30: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months \\nUsing Instantaneous Movements', 'Using Instantaneous Movements \\n($ in billions) \\nDec 31, 2023 \\nDec 31, 2022 \\nParallel shift: \\n+100 bps shift in interest rates \\n$ \\n1.8 \\n2.3 \\n-100 bps shift in interest rates \\n(2.0) \\n(1.7) \\nSteeper yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in long-term interest rates \\n1.1 \\n0.8 \\n-100 bps shift in short-term interest rates \\n(1.0) \\n(1.0) \\nFlatter yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in short-term interest rates \\n0.7 \\n1.5 \\n-100 bps shift in long-term interest rates \\n(1.1) \\n(0.7)', '(1.1) \\n(0.7) \\nOur interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect \\nto benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice \\nfaster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the \\ncase of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward \\nand to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net \\ninterest income. The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from \\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, to December\\xa031, 2023, reflected updates', 'for our expected balance sheet composition, including a shift to \\nhigher cost deposits. The magnitude of the benefit, if any, from \\nhigher interest rates may vary from our scenarios, including \\nbecause future deposit pricing and balances may be different \\nfrom our current expectations. The realized impact of interest \\nrate changes may also vary from our base and hypothetical \\nscenarios for various reasons, including any deposit pricing lags.', 'We use interest rate derivatives and our debt securities \\nportfolio to manage our interest rate exposures. We use \\nderivatives for asset/liability management to (i) convert cash \\nflows from selected assets and/or liabilities from floating-rate \\npayments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa, (ii) reduce \\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) sensitivity of \\nour AFS debt securities portfolio, and/or (iii) economically hedge \\nour mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and', 'MSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \\nare presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in \\nthis Report. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of \\nAFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the \\namount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized \\ngains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS \\nto HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the', 'life of the security with no further impact from interest rate \\nchanges. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting \\nPolicies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity \\nDebt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for \\nadditional information on our debt securities portfolio. \\n44 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nIn addition to the net interest income sensitivity above, we \\nalso measure and evaluate the economic value sensitivity (EVS)', 'of our balance sheet. EVS is the change in the present value of \\nthe life-time cash flows of the Company’s assets and liabilities \\nacross a range of scenarios. It is based on the existing balance \\nsheet, at a point in time, and helps indicate whether we are \\nexposed to higher or lower interest rates. We manage EVS \\nthrough a set of limits that are designed to align with our interest \\nrate risk appetite. \\nOur interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense', 'are impacted by mortgage banking activities that may have \\nsensitivity impacts that move in the opposite direction of our net \\ninterest income. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability \\nManagement – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market \\nRisk” section in this Report for additional information. \\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \\nby changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits \\nthat reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees', 'on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the \\nimpact to net interest income does not include the fair value \\nchanges of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \\nrelated economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \\naddition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \\nnoninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional', 'information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 \\n(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK\\xa0 We \\noriginate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \\nvarious risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \\nrisks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \\nother factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage', 'loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \\ninvestment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \\nmanagement activities. We may also retain securities in our \\ninvestment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \\nthe fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan', 'commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage \\napplicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \\nmortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \\nthe time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing a new \\napplication, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \\nselling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \\non the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest', 'rates. \\nThe valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly \\nsubjective and involve complex judgments by management \\nabout matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in \\ninterest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions \\ncaptured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including \\nprepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the \\nservicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow', 'balances and other servicing valuation elements. See the “Critical \\nAccounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage \\nServicing Rights” section in this Report for additional \\ninformation on the valuation of our residential MSRs. \\nAn increase in interest rates generally reduces the \\npropensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the \\nservicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair \\nvalue of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also', 'reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, \\nwhich reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A \\ndecline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. \\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our \\nresidential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of \\nderivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar \\nfutures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest', 'rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in \\nmortgage banking is a complex process that requires \\nsophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are \\nseveral potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking \\nrelated to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and \\nassociated hedging results, the relationship and degree of \\nvolatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and \\nchanges in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to', 'balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the \\nfinancial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the \\nvalues and income being hedged. \\nThe size of the hedge and the particular combination of \\nhedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce \\nthe volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a \\nrange of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the \\ncomposition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the', 'relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our \\nmortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types \\nof instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and \\nrebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and \\nthe interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. \\nFor additional information on mortgage banking, including \\nkey assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see \\nNote 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and', 'Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report. \\nMARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \\nfrom adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest \\nrates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and \\ncommodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to \\ncounterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, \\nbasis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the', 'trading book, mortgage servicing rights, the hedge effectiveness \\nrisk associated with the mortgage book held at fair value, and \\nimpairment on private equity investments. \\nThe Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s \\nmarket risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In \\naddition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight \\nresponsibilities with respect to market risk, including', 'counterparty risk. The Finance Committee also reports key \\nmarket risk matters to the Risk Committee. \\nAt the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk \\nManagement function, which is part of IRM, has oversight \\nresponsibility for market risk across the enterprise. The Market \\nand Counterparty Risk Management function reports into \\nCorporate and Investment Banking Risk and provides periodic \\nreports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance Committee', 'and Risk Committee, as applicable. \\nMARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading \\nactivities to accommodate the investment and risk management \\nactivities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to \\nmanage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities \\npredominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser \\nextent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n45', 'Wells Fargo & Company \\n45 \\nfor trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans, and \\ntrading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the \\nfinancial instruments used in our trading activities include net \\ninterest income, changes in fair value, and realized gains and \\nlosses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is \\nreflected in the interest income and interest expense', 'components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes \\nin fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For \\nadditional information on the financial instruments used in our \\ntrading activities and the income from these trading activities, \\nsee Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport. \\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to', 'estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial \\nmarkets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with \\nsensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and \\nmonitoring market risk. These market risk measures are \\nmonitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated \\nlevels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management \\nfunction aggregates and monitors exposures against our \\nestablished risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are', 'analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors \\nvarious market risk exposure measures from a variety of \\nperspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and \\nlegal entity. \\nTrading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \\nmarket risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The \\nCompany calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes \\nto establish and monitor line of business and Company-wide risk', 'limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on \\nour consolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 31 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk \\ncategory. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation \\nmodel which assumes that historical changes in market values \\nare representative of the potential future outcomes and \\nmeasures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a \\n1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical', 'simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a \\n12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a \\n12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is \\nresponsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence \\nlevel equates to an expectation that the Company would incur \\nsingle-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on \\naverage once every 100 trading days. \\nTable 31: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category \\nYear ended December 31, \\n2023 \\n2022', 'Year ended December 31, \\n2023 \\n2022 \\n(in millions) \\nPeriod \\nend \\nAverage \\nLow \\nHigh \\nPeriod \\nend \\nAverage \\nLow \\nHigh \\nCompany Trading General VaR Risk Categories \\nCredit \\n$ \\n30 \\n35 \\n20 \\n52 \\n29 \\n32 \\n19 \\n85 \\nInterest rate \\n16 \\n33 \\n9 \\n65 \\n25 \\n25 \\n9 \\n88 \\nEquity \\n23 \\n21 \\n13 \\n31 \\n27 \\n23 \\n13 \\n38 \\nCommodity \\n3 \\n4 \\n2 \\n8 \\n4 \\n6 \\n2 \\n20 \\nForeign exchange \\n1 \\n1 \\n0 \\n4 \\n1 \\n1 \\n0 \\n2 \\nDiversification benefit (1) \\n(36) \\n(59) \\n(47) \\n(52) \\nCompany Trading General VaR \\n$ \\n37 \\n35 \\n39 \\n35 \\n(1)', '$ \\n37 \\n35 \\n39 \\n35 \\n(1) \\nThe period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated \\ncausing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on \\ndifferent days.', 'different days. \\nSensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR \\nmodels, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity \\nanalysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the \\nmeasure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% \\nincrease in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We \\nconduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, \\nvolatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure.', 'Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication \\nof risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market \\nmoves. \\nStress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to \\nadverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, \\nstress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to \\nextreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios \\nestimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions', 'of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit \\nspread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These \\nscenarios assume that the market moves happen \\ninstantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes \\nplace to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative \\napproach since experience demonstrates otherwise). \\nAn inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both \\nhistorical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad', 'range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation \\nand differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the \\nimpact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio \\nvalues. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase \\nacross the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. \\nHistorical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress \\nscenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis', 'addresses how these events might affect the risk factors \\nrelevant to a portfolio. \\nThe Company’s stress testing framework is also used in \\ncalculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s \\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal \\nstress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated \\nto address potential market events or concerns.

The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule to implement the final components of Basel III, \\nwhich would impact risk-based capital requirements for certain \\nbanks. The proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced', 'Approach and replace it with a new expanded risk-based \\napproach for the measurement of risk-weighted assets, including \\nmore granular risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk \\nframework, and a new standardized approach for measuring \\noperational risk.

The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \\nwhen evaluating their capital plans. \\nAs part of the annual CCAR, the FRB generates a supervisory \\nstress test. The FRB reviews the supervisory stress test results as \\nrequired under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of \\ncapital actions for all large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s', 'proposed capital actions. \\nFederal banking regulators also require large BHCs and \\nbanks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the \\ninstitution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during \\nperiods of adverse economic and financial conditions. \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n55 \\nSecurities Repurchases \\nOn July 25, 2023 we announced that our Board authorized a \\ncommon stock repurchase program of up to $30\\xa0billion. Unless', 'modified or revoked by the Board, this authorization does not \\nexpire and is our only common stock repurchase program in \\neffect. At December\\xa031, 2023, we had remaining Board authority \\nto repurchase up to approximately $26.7\\xa0billion of common \\nstock. \\nVarious factors impact the amount and timing of our share \\nrepurchases, including the earnings, cash requirements and \\nfinancial condition of the Company, the impact to our balance \\nsheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements', 'and long-term targeted capital structure, the results of \\nsupervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading \\nprice of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, \\nincluding regulatory requirements under the FRB’s capital plan \\nrule.

This regulation \\nand oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services \\ncompanies conduct business and may continue to result in', 'increased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights \\nthe more significant regulations and regulatory oversight \\ninitiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For \\nadditional information about the regulatory matters discussed \\nbelow and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, \\nsee Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2023 Form \\n10-K, and the “Overview,” “Capital Management,” “Forward-\\nLooking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 26', '(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nDodd-Frank Act \\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform \\nlegislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional \\ninformation on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its \\nrulemaking initiatives. \\n• \\nEnhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important \\nfirms.  The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal', 'banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and \\nregulatory requirements for systemically important firms. \\nThe FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing \\nenhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding \\ncompanies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based \\ncapital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single \\ncounterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity \\nlimits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave', 'threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB \\nand OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress \\ntesting requirements for large BHCs and national banks. \\nFurthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and \\nthe financial and operational resilience of its operations, the \\nFRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of \\ndirectors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, \\nhas finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance', 'and risk management standards for large national banks \\nsuch as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require \\ncovered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk \\ngovernance framework to manage and control their risk-\\ntaking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and \\nresponsibilities for risk management practices within \\ncovered banks and create certain risk oversight \\nresponsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to', 'the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory \\nrequirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-\\nFrank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight \\nCouncil and the Office of Financial Research, which may \\nrecommend new systemic risk management requirements \\nand require new reporting of systemic risks. \\n• \\nRegulation of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank \\nAct established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau', '(CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate \\ndisclosures regarding financial products and are protected \\nfrom unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has \\nissued and proposed a number of rules impacting consumer \\nfinancial products, including rules impacting residential \\nmortgage lending, credit cards, and other financial products \\nand banking related activities, as well as the fees that may be \\ncharged for certain banking products and services. In', 'addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is \\ncontinuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of \\nthe financial services industry with respect to a number of \\nconsumer businesses and products, including mortgage \\nlending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto \\nfinance. \\n• \\nRegulation of swaps and other derivatives activities.  The \\nDodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for \\nregulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to', 'authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity \\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and \\nExchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive \\nsets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, \\nrespectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory \\nagencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared \\nswaps and security-based swaps. As a registered swap dealer \\nand a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer,', 'Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, \\nas well as others adopted or under consideration by \\nregulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may \\nnegatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter \\nderivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new \\nderivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may \\nincrease our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based \\nswaps, and other derivatives activities.', 'swaps, and other derivatives activities. \\nRegulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements \\nThe Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various \\nregulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the \\nFRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules \\nCapital Management (continued) \\n56 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nissued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-\\nbased capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The', 'Company and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified \\nleverage and supplementary leverage ratios. In addition, the \\nCompany is required to have a minimum amount of total loss \\nabsorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. \\nFederal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a \\nliquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For \\nadditional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage', 'and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable \\nto us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – \\nLiquidity Standards” sections in this Report. \\n“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters \\nRules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank \\nAct require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to \\nprepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as', '“living wills,” designed to facilitate their rapid and orderly \\nresolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. \\nUnder the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a \\nreorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the \\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable \\nperiod of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the \\nrisk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the', 'financial stability of the United States. In addition to the \\nCompany’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, \\nWells\\xa0Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare \\nand periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC \\ndetermine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may \\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements \\non us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we', 'adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC \\nultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any \\ndeficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or \\noperations. On June 27, 2023, we submitted our most recent \\nresolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. \\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \\nregime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly', 'liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for \\nthe appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically \\nimportant financial institution that is in default or in danger of \\ndefault if, among other things, the resolution of the institution \\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse \\neffects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is \\nappointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation', 'authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would \\ndetermine the powers of the receiver and the rights and \\nobligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation \\nauthority requires that security holders of a company in \\nreceivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to \\nany losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of \\ncreditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S.', 'Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the \\nstrict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \\nin certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims \\nprocedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ \\nclaims. \\n The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \\nonly material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings.', 'However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \\nbinding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, \\nwhether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the \\nFDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has \\nannounced that a single point of entry strategy may be a \\ndesirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly \\nliquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might \\nexercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is', 'possible. \\nTo facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important \\nfinancial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal \\nbanking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, \\nmaintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to \\nabsorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal \\nbanking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the \\ncontinued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding', 'the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on \\nparent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging \\ninstitutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital \\nand liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an \\norderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to \\nfacilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, \\n2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended', 'and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with \\nWFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and \\nsubsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo \\nSecurities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC \\n(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated \\nfrom time to time as material entities for resolution planning \\npurposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time', 'as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related \\nSupport Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the \\nParent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including \\nthe majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and \\nintercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its \\nsubsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will \\ncontinue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time', 'to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, \\nthe IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide \\ncapital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered \\nEntities pursuant to the Support Agreement.

Six of these policies are', 'critical because they require management to make difficult, \\nsubjective and complex judgments about matters that are \\ninherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially \\ndifferent amounts would be reported under different conditions \\nor using different assumptions. These policies govern: \\n• \\nthe allowance for credit losses; \\n• \\nthe valuation of residential MSRs; \\n• \\nthe fair value of financial instruments; \\n• \\nincome taxes; \\n• \\nliability for legal actions; and \\n•', '• \\nliability for legal actions; and \\n• \\ngoodwill impairment. \\nManagement has discussed these critical accounting policies \\nand the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit \\nCommittee. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which \\nis management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the \\nloan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance \\nsheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments', 'carried at fair value or held for sale.

For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a \\ndiscounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference \\nbetween the fair value of the security and its amortized cost.', 'Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision \\nfor credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the \\njudgment and review required to determine the ACL, \\nmanagement considerations include the evaluation of past \\nevents, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and \\nconditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the \\ninitial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to', 'time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business or \\ninvestment strategy, or products or product mix may result in a \\ncorresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our \\nmethodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial \\nasset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio \\nsegments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available \\nto absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nJudgment is specifically applied in: \\n•', 'Judgment is specifically applied in: \\n• \\nEconomic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast \\nperiod.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to \\nestimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables \\ninclude gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, \\nand collateral asset prices. While many of these economic \\nvariables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some \\neconomic variables are forecasted at more granular levels,', 'for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for \\nunemployment rates, home prices and commercial real \\nestate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the \\ninitial loss forecast period and have currently set the period \\nto two years.

These long-term averages \\nare based on observations over multiple economic cycles. \\nThe reversion period, which may be up to two years, is \\nassessed on a quarterly basis. \\n•', 'assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n• \\nCredit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, \\nunfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually \\nassessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit \\nvariables in our modeled approaches to help assess \\nprobability of default and loss given default. Borrower \\nquality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial \\nstrength and contribute to forecasted probability of default', 'curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted \\ncollateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted \\nseverity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk \\nratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers \\nand subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk \\nspecialists. \\n• \\nUsage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally \\ndeveloped models that incorporate credit attributes and \\neconomic variables to generate credit loss estimates.', 'Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in \\nthe determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and \\nvariables that are leveraged in the models. These models are \\nindependently validated in accordance with the Company’s \\npolicies. We routinely assess our model performance and \\napply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy \\nof loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations \\nagainst the company-wide risk inventory to help', 'against the company-wide risk inventory to help \\nappropriately capture known and emerging risks in our \\nestimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as \\nneeded. \\n• \\nValuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is \\nutilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial \\nasset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply \\njudgment when valuing the collateral either through \\nappraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or', 'other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral \\nvaluations support incremental ACL or charge-downs and \\nincreases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a \\nnegative allowance when the financial asset has been \\npreviously written-down below current recovery value. \\n• \\nContractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual \\nterm of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and \\ncertain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We', 'extend the contractual term when we are not able to \\nunconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension \\noptions. Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n59 \\nwhich requires that we determine a contractual life by \\nestimating the application of future payments to the \\noutstanding loan amount. \\n• \\nQualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in \\nthe loss models.  These amounts represent management’s', 'judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions \\nused in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic \\nenvironmental factors, modeling assumptions and \\nperformance, process risk, and other subjective factors, \\nincluding industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nSensitivity The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key \\nassumptions which requires significant management judgment. \\nFuture amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of', 'factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality, \\nand general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted \\neconomic variables used could have varying impacts on different \\nfinancial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous \\ncredit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variables \\nsuch as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which \\nmay not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in', 'opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. \\nOur sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s \\nview of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We \\napplied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our \\nsensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic \\ndeterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the \\nduration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables', 'within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a \\nhypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately \\n$6.2\\xa0billion at December\\xa031, 2023. The hypothetical increase in \\nour ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of \\nmanagement judgment for qualitative factors applied in the \\ncurrent ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative \\neffect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar', 'sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. \\nThe sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities \\nand other financial assets given its size relative to the overall \\nACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for \\nloans was appropriate at the balance sheet date.\\xa0\\nValuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights \\n(MSRs) \\nMSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage \\nloans for others. We generally recognize MSRs when we retain', 'servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of \\nloans we originate. We carry our MSRs related to residential \\nmortgage loans at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential \\nMSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential \\nMSRs are reflected in earnings. \\nWe use models to estimate the fair value of our residential \\nMSRs. The models are independently validated in accordance \\nwith Company policies. Collectively, the models are used to', 'calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing \\nincome and incorporate inputs and assumptions that market \\nparticipants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs \\nand assumptions generally are not observable in the market and \\nrequire judgment to determine. If observable market indications \\ndo become available, these are factored into the estimates as \\nappropriate. Significant inputs and assumptions requiring \\nmanagement judgement include: \\n•', 'management judgement include: \\n• \\nThe mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future \\nnet servicing income.  The prepayment rate is the annual rate \\nat which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage \\nloan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower \\ndefaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and \\nborrower defaults which are influenced by changes in \\nmortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. \\n• \\nThe discount rate used to present value estimated future net', 'servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of \\nreturn investors in the market would expect for an asset \\nwith similar risk and is estimated using a dynamic \\nmethodology for market curves and volatility. To determine \\nthe discount rate, we consider the risk premium for \\nuncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from \\nservicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future \\nservicing costs and earnings on escrow accounts). \\n•', '• \\nThe expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net \\nservicing income.  The cost to service loans includes \\nestimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency \\nand foreclosure costs, which considers the number of \\ndefaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service \\nloans in default and foreclosure. We use a market \\nparticipant’s view for our estimated cost to service and our \\nactual costs may vary from that estimate.', 'actual costs may vary from that estimate. \\nBoth prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, \\nand generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and \\nmortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in \\neither the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results \\nin a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in \\neither assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of \\nthe MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-', 'driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount \\nrate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the \\nfuture. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in \\nservicing standards as well as changes in individual state \\nforeclosure legislation or changes in market participant \\ninformation regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an \\nimpact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation', 'in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value \\nestimate to independent appraisals. \\nFor a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, \\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets \\nand Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \\nEntities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFair Value of Financial Instruments', 'Fair Value of Financial Instruments \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell a \\nfinancial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly \\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement \\ndate. \\nWe use fair value measurements to comply with both \\nrecognition and disclosure requirements. For example, assets and \\nliabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, \\nAFS debt securities, and derivatives are recorded at fair value on', 'our consolidated balance sheet each period. Other financial \\ninstruments, such as loans held for investment and substantially \\nall nonmarketable equity securities are not recorded at fair value \\neach period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments \\nthrough the application of an accounting method such as lower \\nof cost or fair value (LOCOM), write-downs of individual assets, \\nor application of the measurement alternative for certain', 'nonmarketable equity securities. We also disclose our estimate \\nof fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, \\nsuch as HTM debt securities, loans held for investment, and long-\\nterm debt. \\nDisclosure of fair value measurements for assets and \\nliabilities are made using a three-level hierarchy. The \\nCritical Accounting Policies (continued) \\n60 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nclassification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based', 'on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for \\nmeasurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs \\nreflect market-derived or market-based information obtained \\nfrom independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our \\nestimates about market data. \\nWhen developing fair value measurements, we maximize the \\nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \\ninputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to', 'measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not \\navailable, fair value measurement is based upon models that \\ngenerally use market-based or independently sourced market \\nparameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment \\nrates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when \\nobservable market data is limited or not available, fair value \\nestimates are typically determined using internal models based \\non unobservable inputs. These models are independently', 'validated in accordance with the Company’s policies. Additionally, \\nwe obtain pricing information from third-party vendors to record \\nfair values and to corroborate internal prices. Third-party \\nvalidation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of \\nprices received. \\nWhen using internal models based on unobservable inputs, \\nmanagement judgment is necessary as we make judgments \\nabout significant assumptions that market participants would', 'use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions \\nincludes consideration of many factors, including market \\nconditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, \\nsuch as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in \\nsecondary market activities, may reduce the availability and \\nreliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine \\nfair value. In such cases, adjustments to available quoted prices or', 'observable market data may be required. For example, we may \\nadjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using \\ninternal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact \\nof illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair \\nvalue measurement. \\nWe continually assess the level and volume of market \\nactivity in our debt and equity security classes in determining \\nadjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions', 'can change over time, our determination of which securities \\nmarkets are considered active or inactive can change. If we \\ndetermine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted \\nprices require adjustment may also change. \\nSignificant judgment is also applied in the determination of \\nwhether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as \\nLevel 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this \\njudgment, we consider available information, including', 'observable market data, indications of market liquidity and \\norderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques \\nand significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The \\nclassification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts \\nand circumstances of each instrument or instrument category \\nand judgments are made regarding the significance of \\nunobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value \\nmeasurement in its entirety.

We discuss below \\nrisk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and', 'condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the \\nCompany.\\xa0\\nECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND \\nLIQUIDITY RISKS \\nOur financial results have been, and will continue to be, \\nmaterially affected by general\\xa0economic conditions, and a \\ndeterioration in economic conditions or in the financial \\nmarkets may materially adversely affect our lending and other \\nbusinesses and our financial results and condition.\\xa0 We', 'generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the \\nloans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial \\namount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest \\nincome and fee income that we earn from our consumer and \\ncommercial lending and banking businesses. These businesses \\nhave been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the \\nstate of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and', 'home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty \\nstemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, \\nincluding concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes, \\nand U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact \\nthe global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including \\ninternational political unrest or disturbances, wars, and terrorist \\nactivities, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices,', 'restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliatory \\nmeasures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the \\nstability of financial markets and the global economy. Any \\nimpacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to the \\nU.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global \\neconomy or any deterioration in general economic conditions \\nand/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or', 'any other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the U.S. \\nor global economy,\\xa0could materially adversely affect our \\nfinancial\\xa0results and condition.\\xa0\\nA weakening in business or economic conditions, including \\nhigher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as \\nhigher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers’ \\nability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can \\nincrease our credit losses. If unemployment levels worsen\\xa0or if', 'home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs \\nand provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit \\nlosses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer \\nloan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially \\nfor those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries \\nthat may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The \\nability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may', 'deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE \\nlenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In \\naddition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it \\nmore challenging for us to increase our consumer and \\ncommercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy \\nborrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic \\nconditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest \\nrates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our', 'retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on \\nour consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions worsen \\nand unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a \\ndecrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the \\ndemand for our products, including our consumer and \\ncommercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest \\nincome and our earnings. \\nA deterioration in business and economic conditions, which', 'may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or \\nincreased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely \\naffect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our \\ninvestment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, \\nmarkets and investment banking businesses. For example, \\nbecause investment advisory fees are often based on the value of \\nassets under management, a fall in the market prices of those', 'assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market \\nprices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing \\ncommissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage \\nbusiness. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively \\naffect the performance of products we have provided to \\ncustomers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional \\ncosts. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial \\nmarkets also can negatively affect our debt and equity', 'underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture \\ncapital business and trading activities, including through \\nincreased counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global \\nfinancial markets and economies, including as a result of any \\ngeopolitical matters or unrest, may adversely affect the revenue \\nand earnings of our international operations, particularly our \\nglobal financial institution and correspondent banking services.', 'For additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” \\nsections in this Report. \\nChanges in interest rates and financial market values could \\nreduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our \\nother comprehensive income, including as a result of \\nrecognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we \\nhold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in', 'either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning \\nassets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the \\nFebruary 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net \\ninterest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can \\naffect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our \\nassets and the funding costs of our liabilities tend to move in the \\nsame direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can', 'rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin \\nto expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the \\nyield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets \\nfalls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin tends \\nto contract. \\nThe amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect \\nour yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the \\nform of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets.', 'As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower \\ndemand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield \\nand net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and \\nnet interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged \\nperiod of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower \\nyielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, \\nparticularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher', 'yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. A prolonged \\nperiod of high interest rates, however, may continue to \\nnegatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit \\n66 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nlosses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher \\ninterest payments. Similarly, a prolonged period of high interest \\nrates may increase our funding costs, including the rates we pay \\non customer deposits. As described below, changes in interest', 'rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of \\nour MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB \\nsignificantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate over \\nthe last two years, however, the FRB could decide to further raise \\nit or lower it in 2024. \\nChanges in the slope of the yield curve – or the spread \\nbetween short-term and long-term interest rates – could also \\nreduce our net interest income and net interest margin.', 'Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term \\nrates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve \\nflattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest \\nmargin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding \\nincreases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term \\nassets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which \\ninterest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest', 'income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the \\ninterest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while \\nalso likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with \\nthe FRB. \\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on \\nour earnings under various scenarios that differ based on \\nassumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of \\ninterest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may', 'hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate \\nderivatives. We also experience the somewhat offsetting effect \\nthat our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can \\nprovide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite \\ndirections based on changes in interest rates. \\nWe generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There \\nis always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or \\noption volatility could reduce our net interest income and', 'earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material \\namounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially \\ndifferent than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates \\nrise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve \\nchanges, we may experience significant losses, including \\nunrealized losses, on debt securities in our portfolio. To reduce \\nour interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt', 'securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic \\nactions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In \\naddition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis \\nrisk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. \\nWe have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as \\ncommercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, \\ndebt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to benchmark', 'rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or \\nother financial metrics. If any such benchmark rate or other \\nreferenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or \\ndiscontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market \\nbenchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or \\ndifferences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or \\npayment amount depending on the terms of the governing', 'instrument. This could impact the financial performance of \\npreviously recorded transactions, result in losses on financial \\ninstruments we hold, require different hedging strategies or \\nresult in ineffective or increased basis risk on existing hedges, \\nimpact the overall interest rate environment and the availability \\nor cost of funding transactions, affect our capital and liquidity \\nplanning and management, or have other adverse financial', 'consequences. It may also result in significant operational, \\nsystems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and \\noperational costs, legal or regulatory proceedings, reputational \\nharm, or other adverse consequences. Because of changing \\neconomic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, \\naffecting issuers and the performance of any underlying \\ncollateral, we may be required to recognize impairment in future', 'periods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the \\ndebt securities we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest \\nrates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income \\nalso is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, \\nforeign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in \\nconnection with our trading activities, which are conducted \\nprimarily to accommodate the investment and risk management', 'activities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic \\nhedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt \\nsecurities and equity securities held for trading are carried at fair \\nvalue with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in \\nnoninterest income. As part of our business to support our \\ncustomers, we trade public debt and equity securities and other \\nfinancial instruments that are subject to market fluctuations with', 'gains and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although \\nhigh market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-\\nrelated losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse \\neffect on our businesses as a result of reduced customer activity \\nlevels. Although we have processes in place to measure and \\nmonitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including \\nstress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance', 'that our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding \\nlosses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial \\nresults. \\nThe value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\\xa0Marketable \\nequity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and \\nlosses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are \\ncarried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement', 'alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized \\ngains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity \\nsecurities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may \\nhave a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. \\nWhen, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of \\nfactors, including general economic and market conditions, the \\nprospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company', 'goes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, \\nand whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. \\nNonmarketable equity securities include our venture capital \\nand private equity investments that could result in significant \\nimpairment losses for those investments carried under the \\nmeasurement alternative or equity method. If we recognize an \\nimpairment for an investment, we write-down the carrying value', 'of the investment to fair value, resulting in a charge to earnings, \\nwhich could be significant. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk,” “– Mortgage \\nBanking Interest Rate and Market Risk,” “– Market Risk – Trading \\nActivities,” and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the \\n“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 2', '(Trading Activities), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities) and Note 4 (Equity Securities) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation \\nof our business, and our financial results and condition could be \\nmaterially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage \\nour liquidity. We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a \\nlow-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and', 'Wells Fargo & Company \\n67 \\nthe operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, \\nour sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, \\nour ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to \\npledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the \\nFHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and \\ninternational money through capital markets. \\nOur liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business', 'could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions \\nand factors, including financial and credit market disruption and \\nvolatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial \\nmarkets in general similar to what occurred during the financial \\ncrisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of \\ncustomer deposits, outflows of cash or collateral, an inability to \\naccess capital markets on favorable terms, or other adverse', 'effects on our liquidity and funding. The financial system also \\nexperienced disruption and volatility in early 2023 due to the \\nfailure of several banks, and episodes of disruption, volatility or \\nother adverse market conditions may continue to occur if there \\nare additional instances of actual or threatened bank failures. \\nMarket disruption and volatility could also impact our credit \\nspreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of', 'U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the \\nsame maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. \\nIncreases in interest rates and our credit spreads could \\nsignificantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and \\nfactors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and \\nfunding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the \\nCompany or negative news about the Company or the financial', 'services industry generally which also may result in a loss of \\ndeposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital \\nmarkets; any inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; \\ndisruptions or volatility in the market for securities repurchase \\nagreements, or any inability to effectively access the market for \\nsecurities repurchase agreements, which also may increase our \\nshort-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or', 'restrictions, including changes to regulatory capital or liquidity \\nrequirements; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws \\non lines of credit; any inability to access secured borrowing \\nfacilities through the FHLB or FRB, or any negative perception in \\nthe market created by accessing these facilities; and, as described \\nbelow, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of \\nthe above conditions and factors may be caused by events over', 'which we have little or no control. Similarly, the speed with which \\ninformation is disseminated and the speed with which customers \\ncan withdraw funds in response to information may also \\ncontribute to a faster and greater loss of deposits, particularly \\nuninsured or non-operational deposits, as well as other adverse \\neffects on liquidity or funding, similar to what contributed to the \\nfailure of several banks in early 2023. There can be no assurance', 'that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets \\nwill not occur in the future. For example, concerns over \\ngeopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as \\nglobal economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility. \\nIn addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels, \\nincluding any potential failure to raise the debt limit, and any \\nassociated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may', 'cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the \\nsovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt \\nratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as \\nwell as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing \\neconomic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely \\naffect the market value of the U.S. government securities or \\nfederal agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that we hold,', 'the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and \\nour ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as \\nhave other material adverse effects on the operation of our \\nbusiness and our financial results and condition. \\nAs noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our \\nfunding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial \\nservices companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the', 'rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either \\nbecause we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we \\nlose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of \\nfunding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms \\nof customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive \\nother investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money \\nmarket mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff.', 'When customers move money out of bank deposits and into \\nother investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of \\nfunds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our \\nliquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit \\nbalances in order to manage under the asset cap. \\nIf we are unable to continue to fund our assets through \\ncustomer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms, \\nif there are changes to our regulatory capital or liquidity', 'requirements, or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs \\nor otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on \\nan intra-day or intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest \\nmargin, and financial results and condition may be materially \\nadversely affected. As we did during the financial crisis in 2009, \\nwe may also need, or be required by our regulators, to raise \\nadditional capital through the issuance of common stock, which', 'could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or \\neven eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve capital or \\nto raise additional capital. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management” section in this Report. \\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material \\nadverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, and financial results \\nand condition. Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding', 'are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of \\nour credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow \\nfunds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and \\ncould cause creditors and business counterparties to raise \\ncollateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely \\naffect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit \\nratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’', 'analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, including \\nour capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the \\nlevel and quality of our earnings, and rating agency assumptions \\nregarding the probability and extent of federal financial \\nassistance or support. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing \\ncosts are affected by various other external factors, including \\nmarket volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial', 'services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we \\nwill maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit \\nratings downgrades in the future would not have a material \\nadverse effect on our ability to borrow funds and borrowing \\ncosts. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger \\nadditional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on \\nthe severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse \\neffect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related', 'contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. \\nFor information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk \\nManagement – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and \\nFunding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding \\nadditional collateral and funding obligations required of certain \\nderivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall \\nRisk Factors (continued) \\n68 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nbelow investment grade, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial', 'Statements in this Report. \\nWe rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and \\nfederal and state law, regulatory requirements, and certain \\ncontractual arrangements can limit those dividends.  Wells \\nFargo & Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is \\na separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It \\nreceives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from \\ndividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries.

As noted above, if the economic', 'environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and \\ncounterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or \\nother obligations which could result in a higher level of credit \\nlosses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses \\nby establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The \\namount of this allowance is based on our assessment of expected \\ncredit losses over the anticipated life of our loan portfolio', '(including unfunded credit commitments). The process for \\ndetermining the amount of the allowance is critical to our \\nfinancial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective, and \\ncomplex judgments about the future, including forecasts of \\neconomic or market conditions that might impair the ability of \\nour borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the \\nallowance because of changing economic conditions, including \\nfalling home or commercial real estate values, higher', 'unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in \\nconsumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely \\naffect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory \\nenvironment or external factors, such as natural disasters, \\ndisease pandemics such as COVID-19, political or social matters, \\nor trade policies, also can continue to influence recognition of \\ncredit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for \\ncredit losses.', 'credit losses. \\nFuture allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a \\nvariety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit \\nquality and mix changes, and changes in general economic \\nconditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses \\nwas appropriate at December\\xa031, 2023, there is no assurance \\nthat it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event \\nof significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we', 'experience significant loan growth, we may be required to \\nincrease the allowance in future periods, which would reduce our \\nearnings. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nCredit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – \\nAllowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. \\nWe may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the \\nextent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry \\nsegment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or', 'collateral.\\xa0 Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our \\nloans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or \\nsimilar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group \\nmay be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or \\nmarket conditions.

As \\nCalifornia is our largest banking state in terms of loans, \\ndeterioration in real estate values and underlying economic \\nconditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could \\nresult in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in \\nconsumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely \\naffect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may \\nincrease our credit risk and reduce the demand by these', 'borrowers for our products and services.

The COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could \\nresult in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on \\nus or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already \\nexperienced, including creating additional operational and \\ncompliance risks, such as the need to comply with rapidly \\nchanging regulatory requirements and to quickly implement new', 'measures to protect the functionality of our systems, networks, \\nand operations. \\nFurthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our \\ninfrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, \\nentail significant costs, and create risks associated with \\nimplementing new systems and integrating them with existing \\nones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our \\nsystems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and \\noperating systems, including their security measures and', 'controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and \\nsecurity issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover \\ncritical business processes or operations that have been \\ndisrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and \\nconsequences of such disruptions. Although we have enterprise \\nincident response processes, business continuity plans and other \\nsafeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our', 'business operations may be adversely affected by significant and \\nwidespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating \\nsystems that support our businesses and customers.

Our technologies, systems, \\nsoftware, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be', 'the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, \\nwhich could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of \\nfraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, \\nmonitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our \\ncustomers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or \\nthe disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third \\nparties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have', 'reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large \\namounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card \\ninformation, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur \\ncosts to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n73 \\ntransaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed \\nto the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of \\nthe Company fails to comply with applicable policies and', 'procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security \\ncontrols for personal gain or other improper purposes. \\nDue to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of \\nfinancial institutions and technology systems, an information \\nsecurity incident at a third party or a third party’s downstream \\nservice providers may increase the risk of loss or material impact \\nto us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties', '(including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, \\nincluding those that facilitate our business activities or to which \\nwe outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology, \\nhardware, software, and cloud service providers, continue to be \\nsources of information security risk to us. We could suffer \\nmaterial harm, including business disruptions, losses or \\nremediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory', 'proceedings, or other adverse consequences as a result of the \\nfailure of those third parties to adequately or appropriately \\nsafeguard their technologies, systems, networks, hardware, and \\nsoftware, or as a result of our or our customers’ data being \\ncompromised due to information security incidents affecting \\nthose third parties. \\nOur risk and exposure to information security threats \\nremains heightened because of, among other things, the', 'persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent \\nsize and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services \\nindustry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and \\nmobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote \\nconnectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how \\nthey want to be served, our geographic footprint and \\ninternational presence, our use of third parties, the outsourcing', 'of some of our business operations, and the current global \\neconomic and political environment. For example, Wells\\xa0Fargo \\nand other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service \\nproviders, continue to be the target of various evolving and \\nadaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, \\nmalware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to \\nexploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential', 'validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to \\ndisrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their \\ncybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, \\nproprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also \\nfocused on targeting online applications and services, such as \\nonline banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and \\nservices provided by third parties, and have targeted the \\ninfrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread', 'unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As \\na result, information security and the continued development \\nand enhancement of our controls, processes and systems \\ndesigned to protect our networks, computers, software and data \\nfrom attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for \\nWells Fargo. We are also involved in industry cybersecurity \\nefforts and working with other parties, including our third-party', 'service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to \\nenhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security \\nthreats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to \\ncontinue to be required to expend significant resources to \\ndevelop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate \\nand remediate any information security vulnerabilities or \\nincidents. Because the investigation of any information security \\nbreach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to', 'complete, we may not be able to immediately address the \\nconsequences of a breach, which may further increase any \\nassociated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our \\ninsurance covers aspects of information security risk, such \\ninsurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses \\nassociated with an information security breach. \\nCyber attacks or other information security incidents \\naffecting us or third parties (including their downstream service', 'providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our \\nbusiness activities or to which we outsource operations, or \\naffecting the networks, systems or devices that our customers \\nuse to access our products and services, could result in business \\ndisruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \\nproceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations \\nof applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or', 'other adverse consequences, any of which could materially \\nadversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nOur framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in \\nmitigating risk and loss to us.\\xa0 Our risk management framework \\nseeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established \\nprocesses and procedures intended to identify, measure, \\nmonitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are', 'subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest \\nrate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and \\nreputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk \\nmanagement framework, there are inherent limitations to our \\nrisk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the \\nfuture, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, \\nidentified or managed. Our risk management framework is also', 'dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and an \\nappropriate risk mindset exist throughout the Company. The \\ninability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the \\nappropriate culture throughout the Company, including the \\ninability to align performance management and compensation to \\nachieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the \\neffectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we', 'are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we \\nmay be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We \\nprocess a large number of transactions each day and could \\ncontinue to experience increased costs, regulatory investigations, \\nor other adverse consequences if we do not accurately or \\ncompletely execute a process or transaction, whether due to \\nhuman error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent \\nfraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service', 'provider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, \\ninappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other \\nmisconduct. \\nIn certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor \\nand predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and \\ncredit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, \\nthere is no assurance that these models will appropriately or \\nsufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future', 'events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are \\nsubject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to \\nmeet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, \\npenalties, restrictions on certain business activities, or other \\nadverse consequences, and any required modifications or \\nchanges to these models can impact our capital ratios and \\nrequirements and result in increased operational and compliance', 'costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our \\nvarious risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with \\nthe quality or effectiveness of our data, including our \\naggregation, management, and validation procedures, could \\nresult in ineffective risk management practices, business \\ndecisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or \\ninaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. \\nRisk Factors (continued) \\n74 \\nWells Fargo & Company', '74 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nWe also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or \\nautomate certain business decisions, operations, and risk \\nmanagement practices, as well as to improve our customer \\nservice, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will \\nappropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human \\nassessment or accurately predict future events or exposures. For \\nexample, the algorithms or datasets underlying our artificial', 'intelligence may be inaccurate or include other weaknesses that \\ncould result in deficient or biased data outputs or other \\nunintended consequences. Accordingly, even though we may \\nhave controls, our use of artificial intelligence could result in \\nineffective business decisions, operations, risk management \\npractices, or customer service, legal or regulatory proceedings, \\nreputational harm, or other adverse effects on our business or \\nfinancial results.', 'financial results. \\nPrevious financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory \\nreforms highlighted both the importance and some of the \\nlimitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators \\nremain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells \\nFargo in particular, maintain risk management policies and \\npractices.\\xa0If our risk management framework proves ineffective, \\nwe could suffer unexpected losses which could materially', 'adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nWe may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory \\nproceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to \\ninstances where customers may have experienced financial \\nharm.  We have identified and may in the future identify areas or \\ninstances where customers may have experienced financial harm, \\nincluding as a result of our continuing efforts to strengthen our', 'risk and control infrastructure. For example, we identified certain \\nissues related to past practices involving certain automobile \\ncollateral protection insurance policies and certain issues related \\nto the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection \\nwaiver or insurance agreements. We also previously entered into \\nsettlements to resolve inquiries or investigations by various \\ngovernment entities and lawsuits by non-government parties', 'arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company. \\nNegative publicity or public opinion resulting from instances \\nwhere customers may have experienced financial harm may \\ncontinue to increase the risk of reputational harm to our \\nbusiness. Similarly, the identification of areas or instances where \\ncustomers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, \\nand in some cases has already resulted in, significant remediation \\ncosts, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory', 'proceedings, compliance and other costs, or other adverse \\nconsequences. \\nFor additional information, see the “Overview – Retail Sales \\nPractices Matters” and “Overview – Customer Remediation \\nActivities” sections in this Report. \\nWe may incur fines, penalties, business restrictions, and other \\nadverse consequences from regulatory violations or from any \\nfailure to meet regulatory standards or expectations.\\xa0 We \\nmaintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we', 'comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are \\nsubject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and \\nexpectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly \\ncomplex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject \\nto consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to \\nvarious conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or \\nissue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations', 'and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in \\nthe U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental \\nentities in different jurisdictions. Also, the laws and regulations in \\njurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even \\nconflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal \\nand state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to \\nthe products and services we may offer or other business', 'activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance \\ndifficulties or issues. Additionally, regulatory or compliance issues \\nat other financial institutions could result in regulatory scrutiny \\nfor us. We could also be subject to regulatory actions, including \\nfines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse \\nconsequences, if we fail to obtain applicable licensing or \\nregistration in any jurisdiction in which we offer our products and', 'services. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require \\nus to report transactions and other information to regulators and \\nother governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, \\nexchanges, clearing houses and customers. We may be subject to \\nfines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse \\nconsequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately \\nprovide regulatory reports, customer notices, or disclosures. \\nMoreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for', 'the imposition of fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other \\nadverse consequences for noncompliance even though the \\nnoncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even \\nthough there were systems and procedures in place at the time \\ndesigned to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to \\nregulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control \\n(OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in', 'the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain \\nnon-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. \\nOFAC may impose fines, penalties, or restrictions on certain \\nbusiness activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations \\neven if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the \\nviolations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or \\nregulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or', 'any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, \\nincluding any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent \\norders or other regulatory actions, could result in significant \\nfines, penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, \\nnegative impacts to our capital and liquidity, requirements to \\nundergo significant changes to our business, operations, \\nproducts and services, and risk management practices, \\nreputational harm, loss of customers, or other adverse', 'consequences. Furthermore, these consequences may escalate \\nto the extent issues are not timely resolved or are repeated. \\nReputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged \\nconduct or public opinion of the financial services industry \\ngenerally, could adversely affect our business, results of \\noperations, and financial condition.\\xa0 Reputation risk, or the risk \\nto our business, earnings and capital from negative public \\nopinion, is inherent in our business and has increased', 'substantially because of our size and profile in the financial \\nservices industry, sales practices related matters, and instances \\nwhere customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative \\npublic opinion about the financial services industry generally or \\nWells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and \\nour ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion \\ncould result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of', 'activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other \\nconsumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing \\nactivities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client \\naccounts or investments; lending, investing or other business \\nrelationships; identification and management of potential \\nconflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests \\nwith and among our customers; environmental, social and \\ngovernance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management;', 'Wells Fargo & Company \\n75 \\nincentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or \\ninadequate protection or improper use of customer information, \\nand from actions taken by government regulators and \\ncommunity or other organizations in response to that conduct. \\nAlthough we have policies and procedures in place intended to \\ndetect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party \\nservice providers that could potentially harm customers or our', 'reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and \\nprocedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. \\nFurthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or \\nprevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our \\nbusiness or operations could result in significant reputational \\nharm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses \\nunder the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one \\nbusiness also could affect our other businesses. Moreover,', 'actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain \\nmembers or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect \\nour reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized \\nby Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use \\nof social media by our employees and others, including personal \\nblogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that \\nnegative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be', 'posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or \\nhave other negative consequences, including as a result of our \\nemployees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized \\nmanner in various social media outlets. \\nWells Fargo and other financial institutions have been \\ntargeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, \\nwhich have included disrupting the operation of our retail \\nbanking locations, and have been subject to negative public', 'commentary, including with respect to certain business practices \\nand the fees charged for various products and services. Wells \\nFargo and other financial institutions have also been subject to \\nnegative publicity as a result of providing or reducing financial \\nservices to or making investments in industries or organizations \\nsubject to stakeholder concerns. There can be no assurance that \\ncontinued protests or negative public opinion of the Company', 'specifically or large financial institutions generally will not harm \\nour reputation and adversely affect our business, results of \\noperations, and financial condition. \\nIf we are unable to develop and execute effective business \\nplans or strategies or manage change effectively, our \\ncompetitive standing and results of operations could suffer.  In \\norder to advance our business goals, we may undertake business \\nplans or strategies related to, among other things, our', 'organizational structure, our compliance and risk management \\nframework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products \\nand services we offer, the types of businesses we engage in, the \\ngeographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve \\nour clients and customers, the third parties with which we do \\nbusiness, and the methods and distribution channels by which we \\noffer our products and services. Accomplishing these business', 'plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require \\nsignificant financial, technological, management and other \\nresources, may divert management attention and resources away \\nfrom other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses \\nand ability to generate revenue. There is no guarantee that any \\nbusiness plans or strategies, including our current efficiency \\ninitiatives, will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are \\nunable to develop or execute effective business plans or', 'strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive \\nposition, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of \\noperations may be adversely affected. \\nIn addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest \\ncertain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture \\nmay cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other \\nbenefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than \\nexpected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain', 'customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses \\nor assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other \\nlong-lived assets related to those businesses or assets, which \\ncould adversely affect our financial results. \\nSimilarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our \\nproducts, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of \\ncompanies or businesses in the financial services industry. We \\ngenerally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we', 'can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other \\nfinancial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or \\non what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals \\nwill be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches \\nand/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a \\ncondition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. \\nWhen we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall', 'depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to \\nbe acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to \\nexisting stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue \\ncommon stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, \\ndifficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may \\ncause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, \\nincreases in geographic or product presence, and other projected', 'benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in \\nhigher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an \\nincrease in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our \\nbusiness or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability \\nto retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated \\nbenefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on \\nintegration may also impair our ability to grow our existing', 'businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the \\nacquired company or business operates internationally or in a \\ngeographic location where we do not already have significant \\nbusiness operations and/or employees. \\nOur operations and business could be adversely affected by the \\nimpacts of climate change.  The physical effects of climate \\nchange, including the increased prevalence and severity of \\nextreme weather events and natural disasters, such as', 'hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere \\nwith our operations or those of our third-party service providers, \\nwhich could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause \\nlosses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively \\naffect the financial condition of our customers, increase the \\ncredit risk associated with those customers, or result in the \\ndeterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition,', 'changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on \\naccount of climate considerations or due to the transition to a \\nlow carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain \\nindustries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit \\nrisk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products \\nand services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon \\neconomy could affect our business practices or result in \\nadditional costs or other adverse consequences to our business', 'operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with \\nclimate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and \\nexpectations related to climate change and its impacts, could \\nrequire us to change certain of our business and/or risk \\nmanagement practices, impose additional costs on us, reduce our \\nrevenue or business opportunities, subject us to legal or \\nregulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our \\nRisk Factors (continued) \\n76 \\nWells Fargo & Company', '76 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\noperations and business. Additionally, climate-related data may \\nbe based on emerging practices that are subject to measurement \\nuncertainties or may be available only from third-parties, which \\ncan impact the quality and consistency of the data and make it \\ndifficult to collect, validate, and analyze, impact the effectiveness \\nof our related models, projections, strategies, and decisions, or \\nresult in legal actions or other adverse consequences. Moreover,', 'our reputation may be damaged and we may lose business \\nopportunities as a result of our response to climate change or our \\nstrategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if \\nwe are unable or perceived to be unable to achieve our objectives \\nor if our response is disliked or perceived to be ineffective or \\ninsufficient. Similarly, any overstatement or mislabeling of the \\nenvironmental benefits of our products, services or activities may', 'subject us to legal actions, reputational harm, or other adverse \\nconsequences. For additional information on regulatory \\ndevelopments in response to climate change, see the \\n“Regulatory Matters” section in this Report. \\nWe are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse \\nconsequences from legal actions.\\xa0 Wells Fargo and some of its \\nsubsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, \\narbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning', 'matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and \\nmany of those proceedings and investigations expose \\nWells\\xa0Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse \\nconsequences.

In addition \\nto imposing potentially significant fines, penalties, business \\nrestrictions, and other adverse consequences, regulatory \\nauthorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of \\nwrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection \\nwith settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, \\nloss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital', 'markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to \\nengage in certain business activities or offer certain products or \\nservices, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. \\nFor additional information, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nMORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS \\nOur mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to \\nquarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates,', 'and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to \\nreduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new \\nmortgage loans.\\xa0 We earn revenue from fees we receive for \\noriginating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair \\nvalue of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage \\nloans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from', 'loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our \\nMSRs usually tends to increase due to a decline in the likelihood \\nof prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. \\nWhen rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase \\nand the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with \\nsome offsetting revenue effect. Even though changes in interest \\nrates can cause this offsetting effect, the effect is not perfect, \\neither in amount or timing.', 'either in amount or timing. \\nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge \\nour mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of \\nour risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. \\nHedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant \\nlosses from our hedging activities. \\nWe rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet \\ntheir conforming loan requirements and on government insuring', 'agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and \\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee \\nloans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or \\ngovernment insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their \\npurchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, \\nand thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We \\ncannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will', 'not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of \\nconforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a \\nconforming loan. Similarly, there have been various proposals to \\nreform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role \\nof the GSEs, which, depending on any ultimate reforms enacted, \\ncould have an adverse impact on our mortgage banking business. \\nIn addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that', 'do not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring \\nagencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance \\nsheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be \\nused to originate new loans. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate \\nand Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of \\nResidential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical', 'Accounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” \\nsections in this Report. \\nWe may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse \\nconsequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect \\nto the residential mortgage loans or other assets we originate \\nor service.  For residential mortgage loans that we originate, we \\ncould become subject to monetary damages and other civil \\npenalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or', 'the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as \\nforeclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the \\nloans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or \\nregulations. \\nAdditionally, for residential mortgage loans that we \\noriginate and sell, we may be required to repurchase the loans or \\nindemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or \\ninsurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach', 'of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements \\nunder which we sell the loans or in the insurance or guaranty \\nagreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. If economic \\nconditions or the housing market worsen, we could have \\nincreased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on \\nrepurchases. We may also have repurchase or other obligations \\nto the extent we originate and securitize other assets, such as \\ncredit card loans.', 'credit card loans. \\nFurthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for \\nthe mortgage loans we service, we may be terminated as servicer \\nor master servicer, required to indemnify the securitization \\ntrustee against losses, and/or contractually obligated to \\nrepurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n77 \\nlosses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing \\nincome. \\nWe may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers and/or', 'securitization investors, legal actions, or other adverse \\nconsequences if we fail to meet our servicing obligations, \\nincluding our obligations with respect to mortgage foreclosure \\nactions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our \\nmortgage banking revenue may be negatively affected to the \\nextent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure \\nor other servicing related costs. In addition, we may continue to', 'be subject to fines, penalties, business restrictions, reputational \\nharm, and other adverse consequences as a result of actual or \\nperceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, \\nincluding with respect to our compliance with existing consent \\norder requirements, our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation \\nactivities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our \\nservicing of flood zone properties. We may also face risks,', 'including regulatory, compliance, and market risks, as we pursue \\nour previously announced plans to reduce the amount of \\nresidential mortgage loans we service. \\nFor additional information, see the “Overview,” “Risk \\nManagement – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking \\nActivities,” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of \\nResidential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” sections and \\nNote 13 (Legal Actions) and Note 17 (Guarantees and Other', 'Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nCOMPETITIVE RISKS \\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly \\nevolving financial services industry. We compete with other \\nfinancial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is \\nundergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory \\nreform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and \\neconomic conditions. Our success depends on, among other', 'things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring \\nrelationships with our customers based on the quality of our \\ncustomer service, the wide variety of products and services that \\nwe can offer our customers and the ability of those products and \\nservices to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the \\npricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution \\nchannels available for our customers, our innovation, and our', 'reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all \\nof these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, \\nmarket share and results of operations and/or cause us to \\nincrease our capital investment in our businesses in order to \\nremain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or \\nreprice our products and services from time to time may be \\nlimited and could be influenced significantly by the economic, \\nregulatory and political environment for large financial', 'institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. \\nFurthermore, any changes in the types of products and services \\nthat we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those \\nproducts and services could result in a loss of customer \\nrelationships and market share and could materially adversely \\naffect our results of operations. \\nContinued technological advances and the growth of \\ne-commerce have made it possible for non-depository', 'institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were \\nbanking products, and for financial institutions and other \\ncompanies to provide electronic and internet-based financial \\nsolutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and \\npayment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including \\ndigital currencies and alternative payment methods, may \\ndiminish the importance of depository institutions and other', 'financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. \\nWe may not respond effectively to these and other competitive \\nthreats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to \\noffer products and services at lower prices, increase our \\ninvestment in our business to modify or adapt our existing \\nproducts and services, and/or develop new products and services \\nto respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To the', 'extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new \\nproducts and services or responding or adapting to the \\ncompetitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we \\nmay lose customer relationships and our growth prospects and \\nresults of operations may be materially adversely affected. \\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical \\nto the success of our business and failure to do so could \\nadversely affect our business performance, competitive', 'position and future prospects.\\xa0 The success of Wells Fargo is \\nheavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, \\nincluding our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, \\nincluding commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, \\ncapital markets, risk management, and technology, the \\ncompetition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also \\nseek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of', 'succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract \\nand retain highly qualified employees, we must provide \\ncompetitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, \\neffectively manage employee performance and development, \\nand foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large \\nfinancial institution and additionally to the extent we remain \\nsubject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on \\ncompensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our', 'ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially \\nif some of our competitors may not be subject to these same \\ncompensation limitations. Similarly, union organizing activity, \\nsome of which has been successful, could continue to increase \\nour operational complexity and costs. In addition, our response to \\nthis activity could be perceived negatively and harm our \\nreputation and business, subject us to legal actions, or adversely', 'affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.

From time', 'to time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting \\nand reporting standards that govern the preparation of our \\nexternal financial statements. In addition, accounting standard \\nsetters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such \\nas the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their \\nprevious interpretations or positions on how these standards \\nshould be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting', 'standards and changes in current interpretations are typically \\nbeyond our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially \\naffect our financial results and condition, including requiring a \\nretrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. \\nSimilarly, any change in our accounting policies could also \\nmaterially affect our financial statements.

Pursuant to U.S. \\nGAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions, judgments, \\nand estimates in preparing our financial statements, including, \\namong other items, in determining the allowance for credit', 'losses, the liability for legal actions, goodwill impairment, and the \\nfair value of certain assets and liabilities. Several of our \\naccounting policies are critical because they require management \\nto make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about \\nmatters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that \\nmaterially different amounts would be reported under different \\nconditions or using different assumptions. If the assumptions,', 'judgments, or estimates underlying our financial results are \\nincorrect or different from actual results, we could experience \\nunexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could \\nbe significant. For a description of our critical accounting policies, \\nsee the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. \\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires \\nour management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls', 'and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting \\nand requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control \\nover financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual \\nreport on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” \\nin our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not \\nidentify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any \\ngiven quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our', 'reputation or stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. \\nWe could also be required to devote significant resources to \\nremediate any material weakness. In addition, our customers may \\nrely on the effectiveness of certain of our operational and \\ninternal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those \\ncontrols could affect our customers and damage our reputation \\nor business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit', 'services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to \\npreserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found \\nnot to be independent of us, we could be required to engage new \\nauditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with \\nthe SEC.

Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company (the \\nParent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \\ncompany. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock', 'outstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \\nthe financial services industry. To prepare the financial \\nstatements in conformity with GAAP, management must make \\nestimates based on assumptions about future economic and \\nmarket conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, \\nreal estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of', 'assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, \\nincome and expenses during the reporting period and the related \\ndisclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current \\nconditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is \\nreasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than \\nanticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our \\nresults of operations and financial condition. Management has', 'made significant estimates in several areas, including: \\n• \\nallowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related \\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale \\nand Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities)); \\n• \\nvaluations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \\n(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 16 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \\n• \\nvaluations of financial instruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of \\nAssets and Liabilities)); \\n•', 'Assets and Liabilities)); \\n• \\nliability for legal actions (Note 13 (Legal Actions)); \\n• \\nincome taxes; and \\n• \\ngoodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other \\nAssets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. \\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2023 \\nIn 2023, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \\n• \\nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial \\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt \\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures \\n•', 'Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures \\n• \\nASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair \\nValue Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method \\n• \\nASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from \\nContracts with Customers \\n• \\nASU 2018-12, Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): \\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration \\nContracts and subsequent related updates \\nASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and reporting for', 'troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces \\nnew required disclosures for loan modifications made to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required \\ndisclosures include information about modifications granted to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \\npayment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these', 'modifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \\nfinancial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \\nin the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \\namends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \\nof current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \\nNote 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) for \\nadditional information related to the new disclosures for loan', 'modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \\nfor gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \\non a prospective basis. \\nThe Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \\ncash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \\nlosses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \\nexpected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \\nexpected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications', 'and the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \\nexpected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \\n2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \\ncredit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \\nloans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \\nconcession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \\napply the modified-retrospective transition approach method,', 'resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \\nupon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\\nmodification and post-modification effective interest rates that \\nwould have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \\nas interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \\nour ACL of $429 million, pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \\nearnings of $323 million, after tax. We continue to use a DCF', 'approach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \\ncommercial loans. \\nASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method, which \\nexpands an entity’s ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting \\nfor interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial \\nassets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \\nhedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. \\nWe adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023, on a', 'We adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023, on a \\nprospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the \\nopening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon \\nadoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \\nportfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \\nhedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \\nfinancial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \\nsecurities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger', 'proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \\nof derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \\nincreasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \\nprepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \\nhedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \\ncarrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \\nrelated to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at', 'a portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \\nportfolio. \\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \\nmethod hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update \\n88 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\npermits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-\\nto-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities \\nare designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 \\ndays after the adoption date.', 'days after the adoption date. \\nIn January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities \\nwith an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost \\nof $23.9 billion from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate \\nswaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges \\nusing the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities \\nwas recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately \\n$566\\xa0million of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt', 'securities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of \\ndeferred taxes. \\nSee Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \\nSecurities) for additional information about the Company’s \\nportfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 14 \\n(Derivatives) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \\nhedging relationships. \\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)', '805 – Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \\nmeasure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue Recognition. \\nPrior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \\nrecognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \\nprospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a', 'material impact to our consolidated financial statements. \\nASU 2018-12 changes the accounting for long-duration \\ninsurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \\nthe policyholder in addition to the policyholder’s account value. \\nThese features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \\nprotect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \\nrisk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU', 'requires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \\nthrough earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \\nown credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \\nreinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \\ninsurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are \\naccounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \\nreinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts.', 'We utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \\nrisk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \\nbecause they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \\nThe fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \\nin fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \\nbehavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \\nmortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use', 'derivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \\nthe interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \\nmarket risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \\nrecognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \\nexcluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair value of', 'economic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \\ncredit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \\nadoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \\nretrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \\nin an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \\nearnings and increase accumulated other comprehensive income', 'by $738\\xa0million and $20\\xa0million, respectively, as of January 1, \\n2021. \\nThe ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \\nassumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \\namortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting \\nchanges for the liability of future policyholder benefits for \\ntraditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses', 'and other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in \\nother assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption. \\nTable 1.1 presents the impact of adoption to prior period \\nfinancial statement line items within our consolidated statement \\nof income for the twelve months ended December\\xa031, 2022, and \\nDecember 31, 2021, and the consolidated balance sheet as of \\nDecember\\xa031, 2022.

Our variable \\ninterest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary', 'interests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair \\nvalue of the entity’s net assets. We consolidate a VIE if we are the \\nprimary beneficiary, which is when we have both the power to \\ndirect the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a \\nvariable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \\nTo determine whether or not a variable interest we hold could \\npotentially be significant to the VIE, we consider both qualitative', 'and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of \\nour involvement with the VIE. We assess whether or not we are \\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. \\n Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are \\neliminated in consolidation. When we have significant influence \\nover operating and financing decisions for a company but do not \\nown a majority of the voting equity interests, we account for the \\ninvestment using the equity method of accounting, which', 'requires us to recognize our proportionate share of the \\ncompany’s earnings.

These \\nactivities predominantly occur in our Corporate and Investment \\nBanking reportable operating segment. Trading assets and \\nliabilities include debt securities, equity securities, loans held for \\nsale, derivatives, and short sales, which are reported within our', 'consolidated balance sheet based on the accounting \\nclassification of the instrument. In addition, certain instruments \\nthat we have elected to account for under the fair value method, \\nsuch as debt securities that are held for investment purposes and \\nstructured debt liabilities, are classified as trading. \\nOur trading assets and liabilities are carried on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value \\nrecognized in net gains from trading and securities within', 'noninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are \\nrecognized in net interest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading activities include our \\nactions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments \\nand market-making activities. We also take positions to manage \\nour exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold \\nfinancial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short \\npositions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary,', 'we interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the \\npurchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the \\nanticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we \\nmay purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to \\nmanage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an \\noffsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure \\nto the customer transaction. We earn income based on the \\ntransaction price difference between the customer transaction', 'and the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where \\nthe fair value changes and related interest income and expense of \\nthe positions are recorded. \\nOur market-making activities include taking long and short \\ntrading positions to facilitate customer order flow.

As a \\nmarket-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference \\nbetween the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of', 'the security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the \\npositions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading \\npositions held on our consolidated balance sheet.

AFS debt \\nsecurities are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and \\nlosses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income \\n(AOCI). The amount reported in other comprehensive income \\n(OCI) is net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and \\napplicable income taxes. Investments in debt securities for which \\nthe Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to', 'maturity are classified as HTM. HTM debt securities are \\nmeasured at amortized cost, net of ACL. See Note 3 (Available-\\nfor-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) for additional \\ninformation. \\nINTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION Unamortized \\npremiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over \\nthe contractual life of the security using the effective interest \\nmethod, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a', 'premium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a \\npremium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the \\nnext call date using the effective interest method. As principal \\nrepayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed \\nsecurities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related \\npremium or discount is recognized in income such that the \\neffective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security \\ncontinues unchanged.', 'continues unchanged. \\nWe recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt \\nsecurities in net gains from trading and securities within \\nnoninterest income using the specific identification method. \\nIMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES Unrealized losses on AFS debt \\nsecurities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in \\ninterest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of \\ndebt securities, and prepayment rates which impact MBS and', 'collateralized loan obligations (CLO). Additional considerations \\nfor certain types of AFS debt securities include: \\n• \\nDebt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, \\nincluding federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit \\nmovements given the explicit or implicit guarantees \\nprovided by the U.S. government. \\n• \\nDebt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are \\nmost impacted by changes in the relationship between \\nmunicipal and term funding credit curves rather than by', 'changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities. \\n• \\nStructured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also \\nimpacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets \\nunderlying the security. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we \\nhave the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not \\nthat we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its', 'amortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized in net gains on \\ntrading and securities within noninterest income equal to the \\ndifference between the amortized cost basis, net of ACL, and the \\nfair value of the AFS debt security. Following the recognition of \\nthis impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost \\nbasis is fair value. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in', 'earnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the \\nextent unrealized loss is due to credit losses. See the “Allowance \\nfor Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies \\nrelating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt \\nsecurities classified as HTM. \\nTRANSFERS BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES  Transfers \\nof debt securities from the AFS to HTM classification are \\nrecorded at fair value, and accordingly the amortized cost of the', 'security transferred to HTM is adjusted to fair value. Unrealized \\ngains or losses reported in AOCI at the transfer date are \\namortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortized \\npremiums and discounts using the effective interest method. \\nAny ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model \\nis reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re-\\nestablished. The reversal and re-establishment of the ACL are \\nrecorded in provision for credit losses.', 'recorded in provision for credit losses. \\nTransfers of debt securities from the HTM to AFS \\nclassification are recorded at fair value. The HTM amortized cost \\n(excluding any ACL previously recorded under the HTM debt \\nsecurity model) becomes the AFS amortized cost, and the debt \\nsecurity is remeasured at fair value with the unrealized gains and \\nlosses reported in OCI. Any ACL previously recorded under the \\nHTM debt security model is reversed and an ACL under the AFS', 'debt security model is re-established. The reversal and re-\\nestablishment of the ACL are recorded in provision expense. \\nTransfers from HTM to AFS are only expected to occur under \\nlimited circumstances. \\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES We \\ngenerally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors \\nsimilar to those described for loans. When we place a debt \\nsecurity on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid', 'interest receivable against interest income and suspend the \\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. If the \\nultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual \\ndebt security, any cash collected is first applied to reduce the \\nsecurity’s amortized cost basis to zero, followed by recovery of \\namounts previously charged off, and subsequently to interest \\nincome. Generally, we return a debt security to accrual status', 'when all delinquent interest and principal become current under \\nthe contractual terms of the security and collectability of \\nremaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. \\nOur debt securities are considered past due when \\ncontractually required principal or interest payments have not \\nbeen made on the due dates. \\nOur charge-off policy for debt securities is similar to our \\ncharge-off policy for loans. Subsequent to charge-off, the debt', 'security will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process \\ndescribed above for any cash received. \\nSecurities and Other Collateralized Financing \\nAgreements \\nResale and repurchase agreements, as well as securities \\nborrowing and lending agreements, are accounted for as \\ncollateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the \\nacquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. We monitor the \\nfair value of securities or other assets purchased and sold as well', 'as the collateral pledged and received. Additional collateral is \\npledged or returned to maintain the appropriate collateral \\nposition for the transactions. These financing transactions do not \\ncreate material credit risk given the collateral provided and the \\nrelated monitoring process. \\nWe include securities purchased under securities financing \\nagreements in federal funds sold and securities purchased under \\nresale agreements on our consolidated balance sheet. We include', 'Wells Fargo & Company \\n91 \\ncollateral other than securities purchased under resale \\nagreements in loans on our consolidated balance sheet. We \\ninclude securities sold under securities financing agreements in \\nshort-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. At \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 and 2022, short-term borrowings were \\nprimarily federal funds purchased and securities sold under \\nagreements to repurchase. \\nAssets and liabilities arising from securities and other', 'collateralized financing transactions with a single counterparty \\nare presented net on the balance sheet provided they meet \\ncertain criteria that permit balance sheet netting. See Note 18 \\n(Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities) for \\nadditional information on our offsetting policy. \\nLoans Held for Sale \\nLoans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes originated or \\npurchased commercial and residential mortgage loans for sale in', 'the securitization or whole loan market. Residential mortgage \\nLHFS are accounted for at either fair value or the lower of cost or \\nfair value (LOCOM) and may be measured on an individual or pool \\nlevel basis. Commercial LHFS are generally measured at LOCOM, \\nexcept for certain commercial LHFS in our trading business that \\nare used in market-making activities where we have elected the \\nfair value option. Commercial LHFS are generally measured on an', 'individual basis. See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \\nLiabilities) for additional information regarding LHFS fair value \\nmeasurements.  \\nGains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage \\nLHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest \\nincome. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net \\ngains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are \\nrecognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination', 'costs and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are \\nrecognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at \\nLOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at \\norigination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale. \\nInterest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate \\nof the loan and is recorded in interest income. \\nInterest rate lock commitments to originate mortgage LHFS \\nare accounted for as derivatives and are measured at fair value.', 'When a determination is made at the time of commitment to \\noriginate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold \\nthese loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to \\nperiodic review under our management evaluation processes, \\nincluding corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent \\nchanges occur, including changes in interest rates, our business \\nstrategy, or other market conditions, we may change our intent \\nto hold these loans. When management makes this', 'to hold these loans. When management makes this \\ndetermination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS \\nportfolio at LOCOM. \\nLoans \\nLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of \\nany unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized \\ndeferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized \\npremiums or discounts on purchased loans. \\nUnearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts \\nand premiums are amortized to interest income generally over', 'the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest \\nmethod. Loan commitment fees collected at closing are deferred \\nand amortized to noninterest income on a straight-line basis \\nover the commitment period if loan funding is unlikely. Upon \\nfunding, deferred loan commitment fees are amortized to \\ninterest income over the contractual life of the loan. \\nLoans also include financing leases where we are the lessor \\n(see the “Leasing Activity” section in this Note for our accounting', 'policy for leases) and resale agreements involving collateral other \\nthan securities (see “Securities and Other Collateralized \\nFinancing Agreements” section in this Note for our accounting \\npolicy for other collateralized financing agreements). \\nSee Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \\nfor additional information regarding our accounting for loans. \\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS  We generally place loans on \\nnonaccrual status when: \\n•', 'nonaccrual status when: \\n• \\nthe full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes \\nuncertain (generally based on an assessment of the \\nborrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, \\nif any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; \\n• \\nthey are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential \\nmortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the \\nloan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; \\n•', '• \\npart of the principal balance has been charged off; or \\n• \\nfor junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the \\nrelated first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in \\nthe process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien \\ndelinquency status. \\nCredit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are \\ngenerally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past \\ndue. \\nWhen we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the', 'accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and \\nsuspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate \\ncollectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a \\nnonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash \\ncollected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan \\nto zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise, \\ninterest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received.', 'Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent \\ninterest and principal become current under the terms of the \\nloan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and \\ninterest is no longer doubtful. \\nWe may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a \\nrestructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of \\nsustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial \\nstrength, including documented income, debt to income ratios', 'and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated \\nperformance under the previous terms and the underwriting \\nprocess shows the capacity to continue to perform under the \\nrestructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing \\nstatus. Loans will be placed on nonaccrual status and we may \\nrecord a charge-off if the re-underwriting did not include an \\nevaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay or we believe it is \\nprobable that principal and interest contractually due under the', 'modified terms of the agreement will not be collectible. Modified \\nloans that are placed on nonaccrual status will generally return to \\naccrual status when repayment of principal and interest is \\nreasonably assured and the borrower has demonstrated a \\nsustained period of performance (generally six consecutive \\nmonths of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of payments made \\nprior to a modification, if applicable). \\nOur loans are considered past due when contractually', 'required principal or interest payments have not been made on \\nthe due dates. \\nLOAN CHARGE-OFF POLICIES  For commercial loans, we generally \\nfully charge off or charge down to net realizable value (fair value \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n92 \\n(continued) \\n  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nNote 1:\\nof collateral, less estimated costs to sell) for loans secured by \\ncollateral when: \\n• \\nmanagement judges the loan to be uncollectible; \\n• \\nrepayment is deemed to be protracted beyond reasonable', 'time frames; \\n• \\nthe loan has been classified as a loss by either our internal \\nloan review process or our banking regulatory agencies; \\n• \\nthe customer has filed bankruptcy and the loss becomes \\nevident owing to a lack of assets; \\n• \\nthe loan is 180 days past due unless both well-secured and in \\nthe process of collection; or \\n• \\nthe loan is probable of foreclosure, and we have received an \\nappraisal of less than the recorded loan balance.', 'For consumer loans, we fully charge off or charge down to \\nnet realizable value when deemed uncollectible due to \\nbankruptcy or other factors, or no later than reaching a defined \\nnumber of days past due, as follows: \\n• \\nResidential mortgage loans – We generally charge down to \\nnet realizable value when the loan is 180 days past due and \\nfully charge-off when the loan exceeds extended \\ndelinquency dates. \\n• \\nAuto loans – We generally fully charge off when the loan is \\n120 days past due. \\n•', '120 days past due. \\n• \\nCredit card loans – We generally fully charge off when the \\nloan is 180 days past due. \\n• \\nUnsecured loans – We generally fully charge off when the \\nloan is 120 days past due. \\n• \\nUnsecured lines – We generally fully charge off when the \\nloan is 180 days past due. \\n• \\nOther secured loans – We generally fully or partially charge \\ndown to net realizable value when the loan is 120 days past \\ndue. \\nFORECLOSED ASSETS\\xa0 Foreclosed\\xa0assets obtained through our', 'lending activities primarily include real estate.

Certain government-guaranteed mortgage \\nloans upon foreclosure are included in accounts receivable, not \\nforeclosed assets. These receivables were loans insured by the \\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the \\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are measured based on \\nthe balance expected to be recovered from the FHA or VA. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses', 'Allowance for Credit Losses \\nThe ACL is management’s estimate of the current expected life-\\ntime credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit \\ncommitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and \\nunfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for \\nsale.

For AFS debt securities, losses are estimated at \\nthe individual security level.', 'the individual security level. \\nOur ACL amounts are influenced by a variety of factors, \\nincluding changes in loan and debt security volumes, portfolio \\ncredit quality, and general economic conditions. General \\neconomic conditions are forecasted using economic variables \\nwhich will create volatility as those variables change over time. \\nSee Table 1.3 for key economic variables used for our loan \\nportfolios. \\nTable 1.3: Key Economic Variables \\nLoan Portfolio \\nKey economic variables', 'Loan Portfolio \\nKey economic variables \\nTotal commercial \\n•      Gross domestic product \\n•      Commercial real estate asset prices, where applicable \\n•      Unemployment rate \\nResidential mortgage \\n•      Home price index \\n•      Unemployment rate \\nOther consumer (including credit card, auto, and other consumer) \\n•      Unemployment rate \\nOur approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses \\nfor loans and debt securities includes the following key \\ncomponents: \\n•', 'components: \\n• \\nAn initial loss forecast period of two years for all portfolio \\nsegments and classes of financing receivables and off-\\nbalance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects \\nmanagement’s expectation of losses based on forward-\\nlooking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast \\nmultiple economic scenarios that generally include a base \\nscenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more \\npessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by', 'management to estimate future credit losses. \\n• \\nLong-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting \\nto the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the \\neconomic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast \\nperiod. These long-term averages are based on observations \\nover multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which \\nmay be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n• \\nThe remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for', 'expected prepayments and certain expected extensions, \\nrenewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term \\nwhen we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual \\nrenewals or extension options. Credit card loans have \\nindeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine \\n93 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\na contractual life by estimating the application of future \\npayments to the outstanding loan amount. \\n• \\nFor AFS debt securities and certain beneficial interests', 'classified as HTM, we utilize DCF methods to measure the \\nACL, which incorporate expected credit losses using the \\nconceptual components described above. For most HTM \\ndebt securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss \\nmodel, similar to the methodology used for loans. \\nThe ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \\nvaluation account that is deducted from, or added to, the \\namortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net', 'amount expected to be collected. When credit expectations \\nchange, the valuation account is adjusted with changes reported \\nin provision for credit losses. If amounts previously charged off \\nare subsequently expected to be collected, we may recognize a \\nnegative allowance, which is limited to the amount that was \\npreviously charged off. For financial assets with an ACL \\nestimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the \\npassage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS', 'debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to \\nexpected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is \\nless than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot \\nhave an associated negative allowance. \\nFor certain financial assets, such as residential real estate \\nloans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage \\nAssociation (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. \\nTreasury and Agency mortgage-backed debt securities and', 'certain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not \\nrecognized an ACL as our expectation of loss is zero, based on \\nhistorical losses and consideration of current and forecasted \\nconditions. \\nFor financial assets that are collateral-dependent, we use the \\nfair value of the collateral to measure the ACL. If we intend to sell \\nthe underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the \\ncollateral’s net realizable value. In most situations, based on our', 'charge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial \\nasset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For \\nconsumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have \\ncollateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other \\npersonal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent \\nfinancial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial \\nreal estate or other business assets. \\nWe do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest', 'receivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed \\nthrough interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-\\naccrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For \\nconsumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we \\ninclude an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are \\nneither placed on nonaccrual status nor written off until the loan \\nis 180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in', 'other assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit \\ncard loans. \\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY \\nGenerally, commercial loans, which include net investments in \\nlease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each \\nloan using various risk factors as identified through periodic \\nreviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio \\nreflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with', 'the borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the \\nevent of default, considering the quality of any underlying \\ncollateral. Probability of default, loss severity at the time of \\ndefault, and exposure at default are statistically derived through \\nhistorical observations of default and losses after default within \\neach credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as \\nappropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted', 'economic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit \\ncommitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to \\nderive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated \\nprobability of default and loss severity at the time of default are \\napplied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses \\nfor unfunded credit commitments. \\nCONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY  For \\nconsumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled', 'approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans \\nwithin those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that \\nestimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of \\ndefault and exposure at default are typically leveraged to \\nestimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, \\ngenerally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such \\nas residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.', 'As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further \\nstratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, \\ngeographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use \\nattributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation \\n(FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the \\ndevelopment of our consumer loan models, in addition to home \\nprice trends, unemployment trends, and other economic', 'variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses \\nin the consumer portfolio. \\nOTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for \\nqualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our \\nloss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment \\nof risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the \\nACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level \\nbelow our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic', 'environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, \\nprocess risk, and other subjective factors, including industry \\ntrends and emerging risk assessments. \\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES  Our off-balance sheet \\ncredit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally \\nin the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not \\naccounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including \\nstandby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-', 'balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated \\nwith the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for \\ncommitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our \\ndiscretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial \\nguarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as \\nloans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for \\noff-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in', 'accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. \\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated \\nfor expected credit losses. These other financial assets include \\naccounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-\\nsponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage \\nAssociation (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage \\nCorporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts \\nreceivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as', 'central clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are \\ngenerally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss \\nexpectation (e.g., government guarantee) based on no historical \\ncredit losses and consideration of current and forecasted \\nconditions. Some financial assets, such as loans to employees, \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n94 \\n(continued) \\n  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nNote 1:\\nmaintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with the related', 'amortized cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. A provision for credit losses is not recognized \\nseparately from the regular income or expense associated with \\nthese financial assets. \\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements are generally \\nover-collateralized by securities or cash and are generally short-\\nterm in nature. We have elected the practical expedient for these \\nfinancial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These', 'provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and \\ncustomers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. \\nAccordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these \\nfinancial assets. \\nSee Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \\nfor additional information. \\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \\nFinancial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with \\nmore than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since', 'their origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated \\n(PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities \\nand loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an \\nACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, \\nthere is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; \\nrather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial \\nasset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a', 'corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected \\ncredit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for \\ncredit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income \\nrecognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest \\nincome recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset. \\nLeasing Activity \\nAS LESSOR  We lease equipment to our customers under \\nfinancing or operating leases. Financing leases, which includes', 'both direct financing and sales-type leases, are presented in \\nloans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease \\npayments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the \\nleased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing \\nleases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-\\nparty investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual \\nlease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that', 'we believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The \\nresidual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales \\nprice for the equipment at lease termination based on sales \\nhistory adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets. \\nMany of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at \\nprevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at \\nlease termination. \\nOur allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers', 'both the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as \\nthe estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically \\npurchase residual value insurance on our financing leases to \\nreduce the risk of loss at lease termination. \\nIn connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s \\npurchase of other products or services from the equipment \\nvendor and allocate the contract consideration between the use \\nof the asset and the purchase of those products or services.', 'Amounts allocated are reported in loans as commercial and \\nindustrial loans, rather than as lease financing. \\nOur primary income from financing leases is interest income \\nrecognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease \\nrevenue, such as reimbursement for property taxes, are included \\nin lease income within noninterest income. \\nOperating lease assets are presented in other assets, net of \\naccumulated depreciation. Periodic depreciation expense is', 'recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of \\nthe leased asset and are included in other noninterest expense. \\nOperating lease assets are reviewed periodically for impairment \\nand an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of \\noperating lease assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. \\nRecoverability is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of \\nthe leased assets to undiscounted cash flows expected through', 'the operation or sale of the asset. Impairment charges for \\noperating lease assets are included in other noninterest income. \\nOperating lease rental income for leased assets is recognized \\nin lease income within noninterest income on a straight-line basis \\nover the lease term. Variable revenue on operating leases include \\nreimbursements of costs, including property taxes, which \\nfluctuate over time, as well as rental revenue based on usage. For', 'leases of railcars, revenue for maintenance services provided \\nunder the lease is recognized in lease income. \\nWe elected to exclude from revenue and expenses any sales \\ntax incurred on lease payments which are reimbursed by the \\nlessee. Substantially all of our leased assets are protected against \\ncasualty loss through third-party insurance. \\nAS LESSEE We enter into lease agreements to obtain the right to \\nuse assets for our business operations, substantially all of which', 'are real estate. Lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets are \\nrecognized when we enter into operating or financing leases and \\nrepresent our obligations and rights to use these assets over the \\nperiod of the leases and may be re-measured for certain \\nmodifications. \\nOperating lease liabilities include fixed and in-substance \\nfixed payments for the contractual duration of the lease, \\nadjusted for renewals or terminations which were considered', 'probable of exercise when measured. The lease payments are \\ndiscounted using a rate that approximates a collateralized \\nborrowing rate for the estimated duration of the lease as the \\nimplicit discount rate is typically not known. The discount rate is \\nupdated when re-measurement events occur. The related \\noperating lease ROU assets may differ from operating lease \\nliabilities due to initial direct costs, deferred or prepaid lease \\npayments and lease incentives.', 'payments and lease incentives. \\nWe present operating lease liabilities in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities and the related operating lease ROU assets in \\nother assets. The amortization of operating lease ROU assets \\nand the accretion of operating lease liabilities are reported \\ntogether as fixed lease expense and are included in occupancy \\nexpense within noninterest expense. The fixed lease expense is \\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.', 'Some operating leases include variable lease payments and \\nare recognized as incurred in net occupancy expense within \\nnoninterest expense. \\nFor substantially all of our leased assets, we account for \\nconsideration paid under the contract for maintenance or other \\nservices as lease payments. We exclude certain asset classes, with \\noriginal terms of less than one year from the operating lease \\nROU assets and lease liabilities. The related short-term lease', 'expense is included in net occupancy expense. \\nFinance lease liabilities are presented in long-term debt and \\nthe associated finance ROU assets are presented in premises and \\nequipment. \\nSee Note 8 (Leasing Activity) for additional information. \\n95 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nDeposits, Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt \\nCustomer deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt \\nare recorded at amortized cost, unless we have elected the fair', 'value option for these items. For example, we may elect the fair \\nvalue option for certain structured notes. We generally report \\nborrowings with original maturities of one year or less as short-\\nterm borrowings and borrowings with original maturities of \\ngreater than one year as long-term debt on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. We do not reclassify long-term debt to short-\\nterm borrowings within a year of maturity. \\nRefer to Note 9 (Deposits) for further information on', 'deposits, Note 10 (Long-Term Debt) for further information on \\nlong-term debt, and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \\nLiabilities) for additional information on fair value, including fair \\nvalue option elections. \\nSecuritizations and Beneficial Interests \\nSecuritizations are transactions in which financial assets are sold \\nto a Special Purpose Entity (SPE), which then issues beneficial \\ninterests collateralized by the transferred financial assets.', 'Beneficial interests are generally issued in the form of senior and \\nsubordinated interests, and in some cases, we may obtain \\nbeneficial interests issued by the SPE. Additionally, from time to \\ntime, we may re-securitize certain financial assets in a new \\nsecuritization transaction. See Note 16 (Securitizations and \\nVariable Interest Entities) for additional information about our \\ninvolvement with SPEs. \\nThe assets and liabilities transferred to a SPE are excluded', 'from our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies \\nas a sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. \\nFor transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we \\nrecognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained \\n(including beneficial interests or mortgage servicing rights) and \\nall liabilities incurred. We record a gain or loss in noninterest \\nincome for the difference between assets obtained (net of', 'liabilities incurred) and the carrying amount of the assets sold. \\nBeneficial interests obtained from, and liabilities incurred in, \\nsecuritizations with off-balance sheet entities may include debt \\nand equity securities, loans, MSRs, derivative assets and \\nliabilities, other assets, and other obligations such as liabilities \\nfor mortgage repurchase losses or long-term debt and are \\naccounted for as described within this Note. \\nMortgage Servicing Rights', 'Mortgage Servicing Rights \\nWe recognize MSRs resulting from a sale or securitization of \\nmortgage loans that we originate or through a direct purchase of \\nsuch rights. We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. \\nSubsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. \\nCommercial MSRs are subsequently measured at LOCOM. The \\nvaluation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets', 'and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \\nEntities). \\nFor MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are \\nreported in mortgage banking noninterest income in the period \\nin which the change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at \\nLOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, \\nestimated net servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is \\nreported in mortgage banking noninterest income, analyzed', 'monthly and adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment rates, as \\nwell as other factors. \\nMSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated \\nfor impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For \\npurposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we \\nstratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of \\nthe underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by \\nindividual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds', 'fair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation \\nallowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. \\nPremises and Equipment \\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and amortization. We use the straight-line method \\nof depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization \\nexpense for premises and equipment was $1.3 billion in 2023, \\n$1.2 billion in 2022, and $1.4\\xa0billion in 2021. Estimated useful', 'lives range up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, up to \\n10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the \\nestimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease term for \\nleasehold improvements. \\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets \\nGoodwill is recorded for business combinations when the \\npurchase price is higher than the fair value of the acquired net \\nassets, including identifiable intangible assets. \\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level', 'on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. \\nWe have determined that our reporting units are at the \\nreportable operating segment level or one level below. We \\nidentify the reporting units based on how the segments and \\nreporting units are managed, taking into consideration the \\neconomic characteristics, nature of the products and services, \\nand customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate \\ngoodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair', 'value at the time we acquire a business and when we have a \\nsignificant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion \\nof goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested \\nbusiness. \\nWe have the option of performing a qualitative assessment \\nof goodwill. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative test and \\nproceed directly to a quantitative test. If we perform a qualitative \\nassessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is', 'more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater \\nthan its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. \\nHowever, if we determine it is more likely than not that a \\nreporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we \\ncomplete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is \\ngoodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation \\nmethodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings', 'multiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, \\nwhich is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. \\nA goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less \\nthan the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill \\nimpairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to \\nthe reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge \\nto other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying', 'value of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment \\nare prohibited. \\nWe amortize customer relationship intangible assets on an \\naccelerated basis over useful lives not exceeding 10 years. We \\nreview intangible assets for impairment whenever events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts \\nmay not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of \\nundiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the', 'carrying value of the asset.

On the date we enter into a derivative \\ncontract, we categorize the derivative as either an accounting', 'hedge, economic hedge, or part of our customer accommodation \\ntrading portfolio. \\nAccounting hedges are either fair value or cash flow hedges. \\nFair value hedges represent the hedge of the fair value of a \\nrecognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm \\ncommitment, including hedges of foreign currency exposure. \\nCash flow hedges represent the hedge of a forecasted \\ntransaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received \\nrelated to a recognized asset or liability.', 'related to a recognized asset or liability. \\nEconomic hedges and customer accommodation trading \\nderivatives do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply, \\nhedge accounting. Economic hedges are derivatives we \\nuse to manage interest rate, foreign currency and certain other \\nrisks associated with our non-trading activities. Our customer \\naccommodation trading portfolio represents derivatives related \\nto our trading business activities. We report changes in the fair', 'values of these derivatives in noninterest income or noninterest \\nexpense. \\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in income, except for certain derivatives in which a \\nportion is recorded to OCI. We record basis adjustments to the \\namortized cost of the hedged asset or liability due to the changes \\nin fair value related to the hedged risk, except for basis \\nadjustments related to active portfolio layer method hedges', 'which are maintained at a portfolio level and not allocated to the \\nindividual assets in the portfolio.

The \\nperiodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest \\nincome.', 'income. \\nThe entire derivative gain or loss is included in the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge \\nrelationships, except for hedges of foreign-currency \\ndenominated AFS debt securities and long-term debt liabilities \\nhedged with cross-currency swaps. The change in fair value of \\nthese swaps attributable to cross-currency basis spread changes \\nis excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The \\ninitial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to net', 'interest income and the difference between changes in fair value \\nof the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings \\nis recorded in OCI. \\nCASH FLOW HEDGES  We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in OCI. We subsequently reclassify gains and losses \\nfrom these changes in fair value from OCI to earnings in the same \\nperiod(s) that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the \\nsame income statement category as the hedged item. The entire', 'gain or loss on these derivatives is included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness. \\nDOCUMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT FOR \\nACCOUNTING HEDGES For fair value and cash flow hedges \\nqualifying for hedge accounting, we formally document at \\ninception the relationship between hedging instruments and \\nhedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our \\nevaluation of effectiveness for our hedge transactions. This', 'process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or \\ncash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. \\nWe assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at \\ninception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. \\nFor fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing \\nthe periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument', 'against the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability \\nbeing hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow \\nhedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic \\nchanges in fair value of the hedging instrument against the \\nperiodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The \\nhypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and \\noffset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged', 'due to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for \\nfair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the \\nquantitative measures of the regression results used to validate \\nthe conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we \\nalso formally assess whether the derivative we designated in \\neach hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly \\neffective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the', 'hedged item using the regression analysis method. \\nFor portfolio layer method fair value hedges, an assessment \\ntest is also performed at inception of the hedging relationship \\nand on an ongoing basis to support our expectation that the \\nhedged item is anticipated to be outstanding for the designated \\nhedge period. \\nDISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING  We discontinue hedge \\naccounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly', 'effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a \\nhedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or \\nexercised, (3) we elect to discontinue hedge accounting, (4) the \\nforecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in a \\ncash flow hedge, or (5) the hedged item is no longer anticipated \\nto be outstanding for the designated hedge period in a portfolio \\nlayer method hedge. \\nWhen we discontinue fair value hedge accounting for', 'portfolio layer method hedges, the associated portfolio level \\nbasis adjustment is allocated to the remaining securities in the \\nportfolio on a proportionate basis. Upon discontinuance of all \\nother fair value hedges, we no longer adjust the previously \\nhedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. \\nThe remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item \\nand accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in \\nthe same manner as other components of the carrying amount', 'of the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt \\ninstruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, \\nthese amounts are amortized into net interest income over the \\nremaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized \\ncost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the \\naccumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately \\nreclassified to net interest income. If the derivative continues to', 'be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we carry the \\nderivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with \\nchanges in fair value included in noninterest income. \\n97 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nWhen we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is \\nprobable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the \\naccumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date \\ncontinues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction', 'affects earnings at which point the related OCI amount is \\nreclassified to net interest income. If cash flow hedge accounting \\nis discontinued and it is no longer probable the forecasted \\ntransaction will occur, the accumulated gains and losses reported \\nin OCI at the de-designation date is immediately reclassified to \\nnoninterest income. If the derivative continues to be held after \\ncash flow hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on our', 'consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair \\nvalue included in noninterest income. \\nEMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  We may purchase or originate financial \\ninstruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception \\nof the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic \\ncharacteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and \\nclosely related to the economic characteristics of the host \\ncontract, (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the', 'embedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at \\nfair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if \\na separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded \\ninstrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the \\nembedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate \\nit from the hybrid contract by recording the bifurcated derivative \\nat fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference', 'between the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of \\nthe bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at \\nfair value and accounted for in accordance with its categorization \\nas an accounting hedge, economic hedge, or customer \\naccommodation trading derivative. The accounting for the \\nremaining host contract is the same as other assets and liabilities \\nof a similar type and reported on our consolidated balance sheet', 'based upon the accounting classification of the instrument. \\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING  By using derivatives, \\nwe are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that \\ncounterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as \\nexpected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty \\ncredit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset \\non our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a', 'derivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to \\nthe extent subject to legally enforceable master netting \\narrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same \\ncounterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize \\ncounterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, \\nmonitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements \\nand obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit', 'risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value \\nand our assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Marketable equity securities are \\nrecorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and \\nlosses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in', 'noninterest income. Dividend income from marketable equity \\nsecurities is recognized in interest income. \\nNonmarketable equity securities do not have readily \\ndeterminable fair values. These securities are accounted for \\nunder one of the following accounting methods: \\n• \\nFair value through net income: This method is an election. \\nThe securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains \\nor losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities \\nin noninterest income; \\n•', 'in noninterest income; \\n• \\nEquity method: This method is applied when we have the \\nability to exert significant influence over the investee. The \\nsecurities are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of \\nthe investee’s earnings or losses, less any dividends received \\nand/or impairment. Equity method adjustments for our \\nshare of the investee’s earnings or losses are recognized in \\nother noninterest income and dividends are recognized as a \\nreduction of the investment carrying value; \\n•', 'reduction of the investment carrying value; \\n• \\nProportional amortization method: This method is applied to \\ncertain low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. \\nThe investments are initially recorded at cost and amortized \\nin proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of \\nthe investments and the related tax impacts are recognized \\nin income tax expense; \\n• \\nCost method: This method is required for specific securities,', 'such as Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan \\nBank stock. These securities are held at cost less any \\nimpairment; \\n• \\nMeasurement alternative: This method is followed by all \\nremaining nonmarketable equity securities. These securities \\nare initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value \\nas of the date of an orderly observable transaction of the \\nsame or similar security of the same issuer. These securities \\nare also adjusted for impairment.', 'are also adjusted for impairment. \\nAll realized and unrealized gains and losses, including \\nimpairment losses, from nonmarketable equity securities are \\nrecognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest \\nincome. Dividend income from all nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities, other than equity method securities, is recognized in \\ninterest income. \\nOur review for impairment for nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities not carried at fair value includes an analysis of the facts', 'and circumstances of each security, the intent or requirement to \\nsell the security, the expectations of cash flows, capital needs and \\nthe viability of its business model. When the fair value of an \\nequity method or cost method investment is less than its \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n98 \\n(continued) \\n  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\nNote 1:\\ncarrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value when we \\nconsider declines in value to be other than temporary. When', 'the fair value of an investment accounted for using the \\nmeasurement alternative is less than its carrying value, we write-\\ndown the asset to fair value, without the consideration of \\nanticipated recovery. \\nSee Note 4 (Equity Securities) for additional information. \\nPension Accounting \\nWe sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit \\nretirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan \\n(Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of', 'Wells\\xa0Fargo. We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans \\nthat provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to \\ncertain eligible employees. We account for our defined benefit \\npension plans using an actuarial model. Principal assumptions \\nused in determining the net periodic pension cost and the \\npension obligation include the discount rate, the expected long-\\nterm rate of return on plan assets and projected mortality rates.', 'A single weighted-average discount rate is used to estimate \\nthe present value of our future pension benefit obligations. We \\ndetermine the discount rate using a yield curve derived from a \\nbroad-based population of high-quality corporate bonds with \\nmaturity dates that closely match the estimated timing of the \\nexpected benefit payments. \\nWe use the full year curve approach to estimate the interest \\ncost component of pension expense for our principal defined', 'benefit and postretirement plans. The full yield curve approach \\naligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected \\nbenefit payment cash flows. \\nThe determination of our expected long-term rate of return \\non plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the \\ncurrent asset allocations and expected returns using forward-\\nlooking capital market assumptions. We use the resulting \\nprojections to derive a baseline expected rate of return for the', 'Cash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix. \\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables \\npublished by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our \\nspecific experience. \\nAt year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan \\nliabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting \\nactuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial \\ngain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from AOCI into net periodic', 'pension cost over the estimated average remaining participation \\nperiod, which at December\\xa031, 2023, is 17 years. See Note 22 \\n(Employee Benefits) for additional information on our pension \\naccounting. \\nIncome Taxes \\nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we \\noperate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: \\ncurrent and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax \\nexpense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded', 'for the current period and includes income tax expense related to \\nuncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the \\nmore likely than not recognition threshold are measured to \\ndetermine the amount of benefit to recognize.\\xa0An uncertain tax \\nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit that \\nmanagement believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of \\nrealization upon settlement.\\xa0Tax benefits not meeting our \\nrealization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits.', 'Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes \\nin deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the \\nbalance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is \\nbased on the tax effects of the differences between the book and \\ntax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates \\nand laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.', 'Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s \\njudgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation \\nallowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. \\nSee Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for a further description of our provision for income taxes \\nand related income tax assets and liabilities. \\nStock-Based Compensation \\nOur long-term incentive plans provide awards for employee', 'services in various forms, such as restricted share rights (RSRs) \\nand performance share awards (PSAs). \\nStock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant \\ndate. The cost is recognized in personnel expense, net of actual \\nforfeitures, in our consolidated statement of income normally \\nover the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting \\nare expensed on a straight-line method. Awards to employees \\nwho are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to', 'immediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who \\nbecome retirement eligible before the final vesting date are \\nexpensed between the grant date and the date the employee \\nbecomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other \\nlimited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment \\nends. \\nFor PSAs, compensation expense fluctuates based on the \\nestimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions.\\xa0The \\ntotal expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized', 'upon the completion of the performance period. \\nFor additional information on our stock-based employee \\ncompensation plans, see Note 12 (Common Stock and Stock \\nPlans). \\nEarnings Per Common Share \\nWe compute earnings per common share by dividing net income \\napplicable to common stock (net income less dividends on \\npreferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over \\ncarrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the \\naverage number of common shares outstanding during the', 'period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using \\nnet income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of \\ncommon stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are \\ndilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding \\nduring the period. \\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an \\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction', 'between market participants at the measurement date. Fair \\nvalue is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of \\nobservable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \\nWe measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we \\nare required to record them at fair value, when we have elected \\nthe fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure \\nrequirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a', 'recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value \\nmeasurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that \\nare recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to \\nfair value only as required through the application of an \\naccounting method such as LOCOM, write-downs of individual \\nassets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain \\nnonmarketable equity securities.', 'nonmarketable equity securities. \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n99 \\nWe classify our assets and liabilities measured at fair value \\nbased upon a three-level hierarchy that assigns the highest \\npriority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \\nlowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels are as \\nfollows: \\n• \\nLevel 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical \\ninstruments traded in active markets. \\n• \\nLevel 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar', 'instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or \\nsimilar instruments in markets that are not active, and \\nmodel-based valuation techniques for which all significant \\nassumptions are observable in the market. \\n• \\nLevel 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use \\nsignificant assumptions that are not observable in the \\nmarket. These unobservable assumptions reflect our \\nestimates of assumptions that market participants would', 'use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques \\ninclude use of discounted cash flow models, market \\ncomparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar \\ntechniques. \\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to \\nassess the appropriate classification of financial instruments \\nwithin the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1, \\nLevel 2, and Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes \\nbut is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions.', 'Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will \\ndrive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes \\nin availability of observable market data, which also may result in \\nchanging the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of \\ntransfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

Commercial \\nloan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \\nborrower’s request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \\nindividual basis. \\nOur consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \\nproduct and the modification program offered to the borrower, \\nand may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term', 'extensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \\nloan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \\npayment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \\na result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \\ninterest. \\nOur residential mortgage loan modification programs may \\noffer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower’s', 'demonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \\nis needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \\nloan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \\nperiod of three months to determine if the borrower can perform \\nin accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \\nterms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their', 'original terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \\nour loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \\nsuccessfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \\nis formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \\npayment period totaled $109\\xa0million at December\\xa031, 2023. \\nCredit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \\ncredit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or', 'long-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \\nreduces the borrower’s interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \\ninterest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \\nperiod, the borrower’s revolving charge privileges are revoked. \\nAuto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \\nthree months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term.', 'The following disclosures provide information on loan \\nmodifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \\ndifficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \\nmonths) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \\nthese modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \\nmodifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \\nfollowing the modification.

Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other \\ndefendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment \\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other', 'entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the \\nInterchange Litigation. On July\\xa013, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and \\nthe financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed \\na memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to \\nresolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate \\nsettlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions.

Complaints raising \\nsimilar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the', 'Southern District of New York, IKB International and IKB \\nDeutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, \\nand Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state \\ncourt. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells\\xa0Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert \\ncauses of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s \\nalleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of', 'mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations \\nand warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and \\nabide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events \\nof default. In July\\xa02022, the district court dismissed Phoenix \\nLight’s claims and certain of the claims asserted by \\nCommerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each \\ncase in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix', 'Light and Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court’s \\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \\nCircuit.

The Company \\npreviously settled two class actions filed by institutional \\ninvestors and an action filed by the National Credit Union \\nAdministration with similar allegations.', 'Administration with similar allegations. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \\nWells\\xa0Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \\nthe administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the \\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \\nto include three individual current and former beneficiaries as \\nplaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case.', 'OUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the \\nactions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \\nestimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \\nlosses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and \\nestimable losses was approximately $1.7 billion as of \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023. The outcomes of legal actions are \\nunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is', 'inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or \\neven possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the \\namount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is \\nprobable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. \\nAccordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established \\naccrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on \\ninformation currently available, advice of counsel, available', 'insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo \\nbelieves that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells \\nFargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the \\naggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s \\nconsolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the \\nultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material \\nto Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n137\\nNote 14: Derivatives', 'Wells Fargo & Company \\n137\\nNote 14: Derivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \\ninterest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to \\nassist customers with their risk management objectives.

We use derivatives to help \\nminimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair \\nvalues of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest', 'rate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This \\napproach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of \\ncertain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, \\nforeign currency and other exposures, which may cause the \\nhedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have \\na significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows \\nand earnings. \\nCustomer Accommodation Trading \\nWe also use various derivatives, including interest rate,', 'commodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, \\nas an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading \\nbusinesses.

We generally use \\ncredit derivatives to assist customers with their risk \\nmanagement objectives by purchasing and selling credit \\nprotection on corporate debt obligations through the use of \\ncredit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help \\nmanage counterparty exposure. We would be required to', 'perform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of \\ndefault by the referenced obligors.

If an external rating is not available, we classify \\nthe credit derivative as non-investment grade. \\nOur maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is \\nmanaged through posted collateral and purchased credit \\nderivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order \\nto achieve our desired credit risk profile.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a \\nrecurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading', 'or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 15.1 in this Note. \\nAdditionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments \\non a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments \\ntypically involve application of lower of cost or fair value \\n(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or \\napplication of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable \\nequity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring', 'basis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in \\nTable 15.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that \\nare not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities \\ncarried at amortized cost. \\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value \\nhierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations \\nbased on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the', 'lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on \\nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed \\ndescription of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we \\nconsider all available information, including observable market \\ndata, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our', 'understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs \\nused. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific \\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument \\ncategory and judgments are made regarding the significance of \\nthe unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value \\nmeasurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \\nconsidered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the', 'fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value \\n(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to \\nmeasure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published \\nNAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy. \\nAssets \\nTRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded \\nat fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using \\ninternal trader prices that are subject to independent price', 'verification procedures, which includes comparing internal trader \\nprices against multiple independent pricing sources, such as \\nprices obtained from third-party pricing services, observed \\ntrades, and other approved market data. These pricing services \\ncompile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing \\nfor similar securities when no price is observable. We review \\npricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine', 'if observable market information is being used versus \\nunobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an \\ninternal trader price, compared with other independent pricing \\nsources, considerations include the range and quality of available \\ninformation and observability of trade data. These sources are \\nused to evaluate the reasonableness of a trader price; however, \\nvaluing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from', 'knowledge of a particular market. Substantially all of our trading \\ndebt securities are recorded using internal trader prices. \\nAVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AFS debt securities are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value \\nmeasurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various \\nsources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices \\nin active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary \\nmarkets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such', 'securities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing \\nservices and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from \\nindependent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. \\nSubstantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using \\nvendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation \\nProcesses – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note \\nfor additional discussion of our processes when using vendor', 'prices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes \\nthose classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value \\nhierarchy. \\nWhen vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be \\nadjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also \\nuse internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal \\nmodels use discounted cash flow techniques or market \\ncomparable pricing techniques. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)  LHFS generally includes originated', 'or purchased commercial and residential mortgage loans for sale \\nin the securitization or whole loan market. A significant portion \\nof residential LHFS, and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our \\ntrading business, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. \\nThe remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written \\ndown to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS \\nthat are not part of our trading business is based on quoted', 'market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage \\nwhole loans with similar characteristics. We may use \\nsecuritization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization \\nactivities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market \\nconditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading \\nbusiness is based on pending transactions when available. Where \\nmarket pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we', 'use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. \\nLOANS Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record \\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that \\nare based on the observable market price of the loan or current \\nappraised value of the collateral less costs to sell. \\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs)  Residential MSRs are \\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis. Commercial MSRs are \\ncarried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a', 'nonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with \\nreadily observable prices. We determine the fair value of MSRs \\nusing a valuation model that estimates the present value of \\nexpected future net servicing income. The model incorporates \\nassumptions that market participants may use in estimating \\nfuture net servicing income cash flows, including estimates of \\nprepayment rates (including housing price volatility for \\nresidential MSRs), discount rates, and cost to service (including', 'delinquency and foreclosure costs). \\n144 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nDERIVATIVES  Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis. Other than certain exchange-traded derivatives that are \\nactively traded and valued using quoted market prices, \\nderivatives are measured using internal valuation techniques. \\nThese instruments, which include derivatives traded in over-the-\\ncounter (OTC) markets, with clearinghouses, and on exchanges,', 'are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, \\ndepending on the significance of unobservable inputs in the \\nvaluation. Valuation techniques and inputs to internal models \\ndepend on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying \\nrate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is \\nbased. Key inputs can include yield curves, credit curves, foreign \\nexchange rates, prepayment rates, volatility measurements and \\ncorrelation of certain of these inputs.', 'correlation of certain of these inputs. \\nEQUITY SECURITIES  Marketable equity securities and certain \\nnonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account \\nfor at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our \\nremaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for \\nusing the equity method, cost method or measurement \\nalternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value \\nadjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying', 'value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement \\nalternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence \\nof orderly observable transactions of the same or similar \\nsecurities of the same issuer. \\nWe use quoted prices to determine the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. \\nQuoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable \\nequity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally', 'market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value \\nfor such securities. We use all available information in making this \\ndetermination, which includes observable transaction prices for \\nthe same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing \\nservices, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public \\ncompanies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, \\nwe make adjustments\\xa0to observed market data to reflect the', 'comparative differences between the market data and the \\nattributes of our equity security, such as differences with public \\ncompanies and other investment-specific considerations like \\nliquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the \\ninstruments. \\nOTHER ASSETS Other assets are generally recorded at amortized \\ncost, with the exception of market risk benefit assets which are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis and valued at the', 'contract level using a discounted cash flow model. For the \\nremaining other assets recorded at amortized cost, we also \\nrecord nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairment \\nor the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject \\nto nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease \\nROU assets, foreclosed assets and physical commodities. For \\nthese assets, fair value is generally based upon independent', 'market prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a \\ndiscounted cash flow model. \\nLiabilities \\nSHORT-SALE AND OTHER LIABILITIES  Short-sale trading liabilities \\nin our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, \\nwhere available. When quoted prices for the same instruments \\nare not available or markets are not active, fair values are \\nestimated using recent trades of similar securities. Other', 'liabilities include market risk benefit liabilities, which are recorded \\nat fair value on a recurring basis and valued at the contract level \\nusing a discounted cash flow model. \\nINTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND LONG-TERM DEBT  Although \\ninterest-bearing deposits and long-term debt are generally \\nrecorded at amortized cost, we have elected the fair value option \\nfor certain structured notes issued by our trading business. Fair \\nvalues for these instruments are estimated using a discounted', 'cash flow model that includes both the embedded derivative and \\ndebt portions of the notes. The discount rate used in these \\ndiscounted cash flow models also incorporates the impact of our \\ncredit spread, which is generally based on observable spreads in \\nthe secondary bond market. \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n145 \\nLevel 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes \\nWe generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and \\nliabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices', 'obtained from vendors. Our valuation processes vary depending \\non which approach is utilized. \\nINTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS  Certain Level 3 fair value \\nestimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash \\nflow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the \\ninputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable \\ninputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic \\nperformance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in', 'similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be \\nimplied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to \\nhistorical experience and other third-party data where available. \\nInternal models are subject to review prescribed within our \\nmodel risk management policies and procedures, which include \\nmodel validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are \\nappropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist', 'to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation \\nassesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, \\nincluding reviewing its key components, such as inputs, \\nprocessing components, logic or theory, output results and \\nsupporting model documentation. Validation also includes \\nensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate \\ngiven observable market transactions or other market data \\nwithin the same or similar asset classes. We also have ongoing', 'monitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and \\nliabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, \\nwhich are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models \\ncontinue to perform as expected, include: \\n• \\nongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions \\nand other independent market data (including pricing \\nvendors, if available); \\n• \\nback-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized \\ntransactions; and \\n•', 'transactions; and \\n• \\nreview of modeled valuation results against expectations, \\nincluding review of significant or unusual fluctuations in \\nvalue. \\nWe update model inputs and methodologies periodically to \\nreflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing \\nmodels are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model \\nrevalidations as necessary. \\nInternal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by \\nthe appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function', 'and monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. \\nIndependent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, \\nprovides independent oversight of model risk management, and \\nits responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, \\nand monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing \\nperiodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk \\nCommittee. \\nVENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS  We routinely obtain pricing', 'from third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In \\ncertain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities \\nthat we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve \\nand periodically review third-party vendors to assess whether \\ninformation obtained and valuation techniques used are \\nappropriate. This review may consist of, among other things, \\nobtaining and evaluating control reports issued and pricing', 'methodology materials distributed. We monitor and review \\nvendor prices on an ongoing basis to evaluate whether the fair \\nvalues are reasonable and in line with market experience in \\nsimilar asset classes. While the inputs used to determine fair \\nvalue are not provided by the pricing vendors, and therefore \\nunavailable for our review, we perform one or more of the \\nfollowing procedures to validate the pricing information and \\ndetermine appropriate classification within the fair value', 'hierarchy: \\n• \\ncomparison to other pricing vendors (if available); \\n• \\nvariance analysis of prices; \\n• \\ncorroboration of pricing by reference to other independent \\nmarket data, such as market transactions and relevant \\nbenchmark indices; \\n• \\nreview of pricing by Company personnel familiar with market \\nliquidity and other market-related conditions; and \\n• \\ninvestigation of prices on a specific instrument-by-\\ninstrument basis. \\nNote 15:  Fair Values of Assets and

Option models', 'estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by \\nincorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price \\nof the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. \\nThe unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are \\nthose we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset \\nor liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if \\nby their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability', 'would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We \\nalso consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the \\ninstrument, type of valuation technique used, and the \\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs \\nused within the valuation. Following is a description of the \\nsignificant unobservable inputs provided in the table.\\xa0\\n• \\nComparability adjustment – is an adjustment made to \\nobserved market data, such as a transaction price to reflect', 'dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or other \\nfactors used within a market valuation approach, expressed \\nas a percentage of an observed price. \\n• \\nConversion factor – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a \\nparticular instrument may be exchanged for another \\ninstrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage \\nchange from a specified rate. \\n• \\nCorrelation factor – is the likelihood of one instrument \\nchanging in price relative to another based on an established', 'relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in \\nprice over a period over time. \\n• \\nCost to service – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a \\nportfolio of loans, which includes estimates for \\nunreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and \\nforeclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing \\nsuch loan portfolios. \\n• \\nDefault rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not \\ncollecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a \\nconstant default rate (CDR). \\n•', 'constant default rate (CDR). \\n• \\nDiscount rate – is a rate of return used to calculate the \\npresent value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at \\nthe fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists \\nof a benchmark rate component and a risk premium \\ncomponent. The benchmark rate component, for example, \\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or U.S. Treasury \\nrates, is generally observable within the market and is \\nnecessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money.', 'The risk premium component reflects the amount \\nof compensation market participants require due to the \\nuncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting \\nfrom risks such as credit and liquidity. \\n• \\nFall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans \\nassociated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio \\nthat are likely of not funding. \\n• \\nInitial-value servicing – is the estimated value of the \\nunderlying loan, including the value attributable to the', 'embedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of \\noutstanding unpaid principal balance. \\n• \\nLoss severity – is the estimated percentage of contractual \\ncash flows lost in the event of a default. \\n• \\nMultiples – are financial ratios of comparable public \\ncompanies, such as ratios of enterprise value or market value \\nof equity to earnings before interest, depreciation, and \\namortization (EBITDA), revenue, net income or book value,', 'adjusted to reflect dissimilarities in operational, financial, or \\nmarketability to the comparable public company used in a \\nmarket valuation approach. \\n• \\nPrepayment rate – is the estimated rate at which forecasted \\nprepayments of principal of the related loan or debt \\ninstrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant \\nprepayment rate (CPR). \\n• \\nVolatility factor – is the extent of change in price an item is \\nestimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time', 'expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a \\nperiod over time. \\n• \\nWeighted average life – is the weighted average number of \\nyears an investment is expected to remain outstanding \\nbased on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated \\ndate the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the \\ninstrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing \\nof an instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not \\ncontractually fixed.', 'contractually fixed. \\nInterrelationships and Uncertainty of Inputs Used in \\nRecurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements \\nUsage of the valuation techniques presented in Table 15.3 \\nrequires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some \\nof which represent significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, \\nchanges in these unobservable inputs may have a significant \\nimpact on fair value. \\nCertain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a', 'directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the \\ninstrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair \\nvalue of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a \\ngiven change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used \\nwithin the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in \\none input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite \\nchange in another input having a potentially muted impact to the', 'overall fair value of that particular instrument. Additionally, a \\nchange in one unobservable input may result in a change to \\nanother unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are \\ninterrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify \\nthe fair value impact. \\nDEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE\\xa0 The internal models \\nused to determine fair value for these Level 3 instruments use \\ncertain significant unobservable inputs within a discounted cash', 'flow or market comparable pricing valuation technique.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \\nSPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \\ngenerally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \\nmay alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative', 'transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \\nforms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \\nsometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \\nwe transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \\nright to service the transferred assets and repurchase the', 'transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \\nbelow the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \\nbenefits.

These loans are \\ngenerally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs,', 'which provide certain credit guarantees to investors and \\nservicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization \\npools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association \\n(GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing \\nAdministration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of \\nVeterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization \\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The \\nGSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations,', 'sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities \\nmost significant to the VIE. \\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \\nthe transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing', 'rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option \\nto repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which \\nbecomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when \\nthree scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the \\nunilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and \\na corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our \\nintent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to', 'the securitization. At December\\xa031, 2023 and 2022, we recorded \\nassets and related liabilities of $1.0\\xa0billion and $743\\xa0million, \\nrespectively, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase \\neligible loans. During the years ended December\\xa031, 2023, 2022 \\nand 2021, we repurchased loans of $293\\xa0million, $2.2 billion, and \\n$4.6 billion, respectively. \\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual', 'representations and warranties as well as other recourse \\narrangements. At December\\xa031, 2023 and 2022, our liability for \\nthese repurchase and recourse arrangements was $229\\xa0million \\nand $167\\xa0million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to \\nloss was $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion at December\\xa031, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively. \\nSubstantially all residential servicing activity is related to \\nassets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6', '(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about \\nresidential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \\nservicing fees. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage \\nloans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. \\nNonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a \\ngovernment credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest', 'holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by \\nthe securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred \\nloans and account for the transfers as sales. We also typically \\nretain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial \\ninterests issued by the VIE, such as debt securities held for \\ninvestment purposes. Our servicing role related to \\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is', 'limited to primary or master servicer. We do not consolidate the \\nVIE because the most significant decisions impacting the \\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer \\nor the controlling class security holder.

In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider \\nthe credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \\nFor our guarantees in Table 17.1, non-investment grade \\nrepresents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of \\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee, which is', 'determined based on an external rating or an internal credit \\ngrade that is below investment grade, if applicable. \\nSTANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue standby letters of credit, \\nwhich include performance and financial guarantees, for \\ncustomers in connection with contracts between our customers \\nand third parties.

The maximum \\nexposure to loss represents the outstanding principal balance of \\nthe loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse \\nprovisions or the maximum losses per the contractual \\nagreements.

Some membership rules require members to \\nassume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another \\nmember’s default or from non-member default losses after \\napplying the guarantee fund.

We offset market risk related to options \\nwritten to customers with cash securities or other offsetting \\nderivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these', 'contracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying \\ninstrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate \\nobligation under written options is based on future market \\nconditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. The fair value of \\nwritten options represents our view of the probability that we \\nwill be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of \\nthese written options was an asset of $178 million and a liability', 'of $15 million at December\\xa031, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The \\nfair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on \\ncertain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents \\nthe notional value of these derivative contracts. At December\\xa031, \\n2023, the maximum exposure to loss was $34.0\\xa0billion, with \\n$31.9\\xa0billion expiring in three years or less compared with \\n$23.4\\xa0billion and $21.3 billion, respectively, at December\\xa031,', '2022. See Note 14 (Derivatives) for additional information \\nregarding written derivative contracts. \\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks \\ndirectly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing \\nservicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is \\naccounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the \\nmerchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in', 'connection with payment and delivery disputes between the \\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the \\ncardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. If we are \\nunable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss \\nfor the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to \\nmake a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant \\nprocessing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in', 'connection with our merchant processing services because most \\nproducts and services are delivered when purchased and \\namounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the \\nmerchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with \\nthese transactions by withholding future payments and requiring \\ncash or other collateral. We estimate our potential maximum \\nexposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed', 'in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a \\ncharge-back transaction. As of December\\xa031, 2023, our potential \\nmaximum exposure was approximately $761.9 billion, and \\nrelated losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were \\ninsignificant. \\nGUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES In the normal course of business, \\nthe Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related \\nto its subsidiaries’ obligations. These obligations are included in', 'the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as \\noff-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has \\nnot recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. \\nAdditionally, the Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees \\nthe payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that \\nmay be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, \\nWells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not \\nguaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The', 'guaranteed liabilities were $834 million and $948 million at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These guarantees \\nrank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and \\nunsubordinated indebtedness. \\nThe assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its \\nsubsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity \\nfrom its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address \\nclaims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent', 'under the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of \\ndividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If \\nany of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct \\ncreditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that \\nsubsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the \\nParent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the \\nParent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary. For additional', 'information regarding other restrictions on the Parent’s ability to \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n161 \\nreceive dividends, loan payments and other funds from its \\nsubsidiaries, see Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and \\nOther Restrictions). \\nOTHER COMMITMENTS We may enter into commitments to \\npurchase debt and equity securities for various business or \\ninvestment purposes. As of December\\xa031, 2023 and 2022, we \\nhad commitments to purchase debt securities of $0 and', '$100\\xa0million, respectively, and commitments to purchase equity \\nsecurities of $9.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. As of \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023, our commitments to purchase equity \\nsecurities predominantly included Federal Reserve Bank stock \\nand renewable energy investments. \\nAs part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing \\norganizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity \\nto sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen', 'events occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these \\nobligations are guarantees of other members’ performance and \\naccordingly are included in Table 17.1 in Other guarantees and \\nindemnifications. \\nWe have commitments to enter into resale and securities \\nborrowing agreements as well as repurchase and securities \\nlending agreements with certain counterparties, including central \\nclearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded contractual', 'commitments for resale and securities borrowing agreements \\nwas $17.5\\xa0billion and $19.9 billion as of December\\xa031, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively. The amount of our unfunded contractual \\ncommitments for repurchase and securities lending agreements \\nwas $746\\xa0million and $1.6 billion as of December\\xa031, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively. \\nGiven the nature of these commitments, they are excluded \\nfrom Table 5.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 5 \\n(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses).', '(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses). \\nNote 17:\\xa0 Guarantees and Other Commitments (continued) \\n162 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nNote 18: Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities \\nWe enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities \\nborrowing and lending agreements (collectively, “securities \\nfinancing activities”) typically to finance trading positions \\n(including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to cover', 'short trading positions, accommodate customers’ financing \\nneeds, and settle other securities obligations. These activities are \\nconducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser \\nextent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing \\nactivities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as \\nU.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, \\nto a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity', 'securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We \\naccount for these transactions as collateralized financings in \\nwhich we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We \\nbelieve these financing transactions generally do not have \\nmaterial credit risk given the collateral provided and the related \\nmonitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements \\ninvolving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of \\nour commercial lending business activities.', 'our commercial lending business activities. \\nOFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED \\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 18.1 presents resale and repurchase \\nagreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) \\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to \\nmaster securities lending agreements (MSLA). Where legally \\nenforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, \\nin the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities', 'held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the \\nsame counterparty. Collateralized financings with the same \\ncounterparty are presented net on our consolidated balance \\nsheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit balance sheet \\nnetting. The majority of transactions subject to these \\nagreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not eligible \\nfor balance sheet netting. \\nCollateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments,', 'such as securities or loans, and is not netted on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet against the related liability. Collateral we received \\nincludes securities or loans and is not recognized on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may \\nbe increased or decreased over time to maintain certain \\ncontractual thresholds, as the assets underlying each \\narrangement fluctuate in value. For additional information on \\ncollateral pledged and accepted, see Note 19\\xa0(Pledged Assets', 'and Collateral). Generally, these agreements require collateral to \\nexceed the asset or liability recognized on the balance sheet. The \\nfollowing table includes the amount of collateral pledged or \\nreceived related to exposures subject to enforceable MRAs or \\nMSLAs. While these agreements are typically over-collateralized, \\nthe disclosure in this table is limited to the reported amount of \\nsuch collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset or \\nliability for\\xa0each counterparty.', 'liability for\\xa0each counterparty. \\nIn addition to the amounts included in Table 18.1, we also \\nhave balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is disclosed \\nin Note 14 (Derivatives). \\nTable 18.1: Offsetting – Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities \\n(in millions) \\nDec 31, \\n2023 \\nDec 31, \\n2022 \\nAssets: \\nResale and securities borrowing agreements \\nGross amounts recognized \\n$ \\n129,282 \\n114,729 \\nGross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) \\n(28,402) \\n(24,464)', '(28,402) \\n(24,464) \\nNet amounts in consolidated balance sheet (2) \\n100,880 \\n90,265 \\nCollateral received not recognized in consolidated balance sheet (3) \\n(99,970) \\n(89,592) \\nNet amount (4) \\n$ \\n910 \\n673 \\nLiabilities: \\nRepurchase and securities lending agreements \\nGross amounts recognized \\n$ \\n106,060 \\n55,054 \\nGross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) \\n(28,402) \\n(24,464) \\nNet amounts in consolidated balance sheet (5) \\n77,658 \\n30,590', '77,658 \\n30,590 \\nCollateral pledged but not netted in consolidated balance sheet (6) \\n(77,529) \\n(30,383) \\nNet amount (4) \\n$ \\n129 \\n207 \\n(1) \\nRepresents recognized amount of resale and repurchase agreements with counterparties subject  to enforceable MRAs that have been offset within our consolidated balance sheet. \\n(2)', '(2) \\nIncludes $80.4 billion and $68.0 billion classified on our consolidated balance sheet in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements at December\\xa031, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange', 'for transferring securities as collateral and recognize an \\nobligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction’s \\nmaturity. These types of transactions create risks, including \\n(1)\\xa0the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, \\n(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below \\nthe amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and \\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional', 'amounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity \\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to \\ncontractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in \\nvarious ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid \\nsecurities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial \\nstrength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of \\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase', 'amounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned \\nthrough the clearing and settlement process in advance of our \\ncash repayment.

Our responsibility is to express an \\nopinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and', 'are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to', 'error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial \\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,', 'taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit \\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \\nAssessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans (ACL) \\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s ACL as of December\\xa031, 2023 was', '$15.1\\xa0billion. The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk \\ncharacteristics and on an individual basis for those loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. The Company estimated the \\nACL for collectively evaluated commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected', 'exposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived utilizing credit loss models \\nbased on historical observations of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for \\ncollectively evaluated consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which estimate expected credit losses in the portfolio based on', 'historical experience of probability of default and severity of loss estimates. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic \\nvariables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts \\nmultiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to estimate expected credit losses. After the', 'reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the \\nforecasted economic variables based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. The Company estimated the ACL for \\nindividually evaluated commercial loans using discounted cash flow (DCF) or fair value of collateral methods. A portion of the ACL is \\ncomprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models.', 'We identified the assessment of the ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and \\nknowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment \\nencompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to', 'estimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable \\nforecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for \\nqualitative factors that may not be adequately captured in the loss models. The assessment included an evaluation of the \\n186 \\nWells Fargo & Company', '186 \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nconceptual soundness and performance of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models. The assessment also encompassed \\nthe evaluation of the DCF and fair value of collateral methods and assumptions used to estimate the ACL for individually evaluated \\ncommercial real estate (CRE) loans. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence \\nobtained.', 'obtained. \\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. \\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of the ACL \\nestimate, including controls over the: \\n• \\ndevelopment of certain credit loss models \\n• \\ncontinued use and appropriateness of changes made to certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \\n•', '• \\nperformance monitoring of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \\n• \\nidentification and determination of the significant assumptions used in certain credit loss and economic forecasting models \\n• \\ndevelopment of the qualitative factors, including significant assumptions used in the measurement of certain qualitative \\nfactors \\n• \\nevaluation of the DCF and fair value of collateral assessments used to determine the expected credit losses for individually \\nevaluated CRE loans \\n•', 'evaluated CRE loans \\n• \\nanalysis of the ACL results, trends, and ratios. \\nWe evaluated the Company’s process to develop the estimate by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the Company \\nused and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals \\nwith specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \\n•', '• \\nevaluating the Company’s ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \\n• \\nevaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the development, assessment and performance testing of certain \\ncredit loss models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and \\nregulatory practices \\n•', 'regulatory practices \\n• \\nassessing the conceptual soundness of the credit loss models, including the selection of certain assumptions, by inspecting the \\nmodel documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use \\n• \\nevaluating the methodology used to develop the forecasted economic scenarios, the selection of underlying assumptions and \\nthe weighting of scenarios by comparing them to the Company’s business environment \\n•', '• \\nassessing the forecasted economic scenarios through comparison to publicly available forecasts \\n• \\ntesting the historical observation period and reasonable and supportable forecast periods to evaluate the length of each period \\n• \\ntesting individual credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, \\nsources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral \\n•', '• \\nevaluating the methods and assumptions used to develop certain qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the ACL \\ncompared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying \\nquantitative models \\n• \\nevaluating the methods and assumptions used by the Company in the DCF and fair value of collateral assessments for', 'individually evaluated CRE loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any \\nrelevant guarantees or underlying collateral. \\nWe also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the ACL estimate by evaluating the: \\n• \\ncumulative results of the audit procedures \\n• \\nqualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices \\n• \\npotential bias in the accounting estimates. \\nWells Fargo & Company \\n187', 'Wells Fargo & Company \\n187 \\nAssessment of the residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \\nAs discussed in Notes 1, 6, 15, and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s residential MSR asset as of \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 was $7.5 billion on an underlying loan servicing portfolio of $560 billion. The Company recognizes MSRs when it \\nretains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third', 'parties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a \\nvaluation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, \\nwhich incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These', 'assumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service \\n(including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late \\nfees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. \\nWe identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including', 'specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs. \\nSpecifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity used to evaluate the valuation model and the following assumptions because \\nthey are unobservable and the sensitivity of changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the valuation (1) prepayment', 'rates, (2) discount rates, and (3) cost to service.

The financial forecasts include future', 'expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and considerations related to future business activities. The \\nforecasted cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from a capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of \\nequity to the reporting unit. The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies and', 'incorporates assumptions including the selection of comparable companies and a control premium representative of management’s \\nexpectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. \\nWe identified the assessment of goodwill impairment for the Consumer Lending reporting unit, which had $7.1 billion of allocated \\ngoodwill as of December\\xa031, 2023, as a critical audit matter.A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge,', 'and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment.
