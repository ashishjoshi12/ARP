In contrast, machine learning allows a computer to learn from experience, identify patterns in data, and adapt its behavior based on that learning.\n","\n","Machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets, which can be structured (e.g., tables) or unstructured (e.g., images, text). The algorithm analyzes the data, identifies relationships between variables, and makes predictions or decisions. As more data becomes available, the algorithm can refine its performance by updating its internal models and rules.\n","\n","Machine learning has many applications across industries, including:\n","\n","1. **Predictive analytics**: Analyzing customer behavior, predicting sales trends, or forecasting stock prices.\n","2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understanding and generating human language, enabling chatbots, voice assistants, and language translation systems.\n","3. **Computer Vision**: Recognizing objects, scenes, and activities from visual data, used in applications like self-driving cars, facial recognition, and medical imaging analysis.\n","4. **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting products or services based on user behavior and preferences, found in e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and social media.\n","5. **Autonomous systems**: Enabling robots to navigate and make decisions without human intervention, used in industries like manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare.\n","\n","Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into several types:\n","\n","1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the correct output is provided for each input.\n","2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm discovers patterns and relationships in unlabeled data.\n","3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.\n","\n","Machine learning has many benefits, including:\n","\n","1. **Improved accuracy**: ML algorithms can analyze large datasets and identify complex patterns that may not be apparent to humans.\n","2. **Increased efficiency**: ML can automate tasks and processes, freeing up human resources for more strategic or creative work.\n","3. **Enhanced decision-making**: ML can provide insights and recommendations based on data-driven analysis.\n","\n","However, machine learning also presents challenges, such as:\n","\n","1. **Data quality**: The algorithm's performance is only as good as the data it was trained on.\n","2. **Interpretability**: It can be difficult to understand why an ML model made a particular decision or prediction.\n","3. **Bias and fairness**: ML models can perpetuate biases in the data they were trained on, if not carefully designed to mitigate these issues.\n","\n","Overall, machine learning has revolutionized many industries and has the potential to continue transforming the way we live and work.\n"]}],"source":["import

Business.\n","Company Overview\n","GXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“GXO,” the “Company,” “our” or “we”), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world and a foremost innovator in an industry\n","propelled by strong secular tailwinds. We provide our customers with high-value-added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services\n","differentiated by our ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at scale. As of December 31, 2023, our 131,000 team members operated in 974 facilities worldwide totaling 199\n","million square feet of space, primarily on behalf of large corporations that have outsourced their warehousing, distribution and other related activities to us.\n","Our revenue is diversified among over one thousand customers, including many multinational corporations, across numerous verticals. Our customers rely on us to move their goods, with high\n","efficiency, through their supply chains — from the moment goods arrive at our warehouses through fulfillment and distribution, and the management of returned products. Our customer base includes\n","many blue-chip leaders in sectors that demonstrate high growth and/or durable demand, with significant growth potential through customer outsourcing of logistics services.\n","GXO became a standalone publicly traded company on August 2, 2021, when GXO completed its separation (the “Separation”) from XPO, Inc. (“XPO”) and began regular-way trading on the New\n","York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GXO.” GXO was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2021.\n","Our Strategy\n","We design and operate the most advanced warehouse solutions in the world. Our strategy is to help our customers manage their warehouse needs for optimal efficiency, using our network of people,\n","technology and other physical assets. We deliver value to customers in the form of technological innovations, process efficiencies, cost efficiencies and reliable outcomes. Our services are highly\n","responsive to customer goals, such as increasing visibility in the supply chain, decreasing fulfillment times and mitigating environmental impacts, while being proactive in identifying potential\n","improvements.\n","GXO creates short- and long-term value for customers and shareholders through our unique combination of technology, scale and expertise. Our strategy addresses growth and optimization by\n","focusing on core verticals that demonstrate enduring demand over time and where we already have a deep presence. We expect to attract new customers and expand the services we provide to\n","existing customers through new projects, thus earning more of their logistics spend. We integrate best practices to drive productivity, with a focus on automation and other levers of profitable growth.\n","To aid in executing our strategy, we have instilled a culture that focuses on delivering mutually beneficial results for our customers and our company with the highest legal and ethical standards and\n","clear policies and practices to support compliance throughout our organization.\n","Technology and Intellectual Property\n","Contract logistics is becoming more and more complex, as changing consumer expectations and preferences continue to drive a need for faster delivery times, higher levels of returned inventory and\n","better visibility throughout the supply chain. Traditional warehousing solutions are no longer sufficient to fill these needs. The industry needs scaled technology players, like GXO, to deliver these\n","complex solutions.\n","Technology is a core competitive advantage for GXO and fundamental to how we win and retain business. GXO was an early adopter of technology, and more than 30% of our warehouses are\n","technology-enabled compared to the industry average of approximately 10%. Technology enables us to add value to our customers’ end-to-end\n","1\n","operations in terms of cost, efficiency, accuracy and environmental impact. Investments in cutting-edge technology are a major growth driver for our business.\n","Our highly scalable warehouse management platform is built on the cloud to speed the deployment of new ways to increase efficiency and leverage our footprint. In a relatively short time, we can\n","implement innovations across multiple geographies or take an innovation developed for one vertical and apply it to other verticals to enhance the value we offer our customers.\n","To date, the most significant impacts of our proprietary technology are in three areas: labor and inventory management productivity, intelligent warehouse automation and predictive analytics, all of\n","which are integrated through our proprietary warehouse management platform.\n","Labor and Inventory Management\n","Our productivity is driven by our comprehensive suite of intelligent tools and analytics designed to optimize labor and inventory management. This technology incorporates dynamic data science,\n","predictive analytics and machine learning to aid decision-making. Our site managers use these tools to improve productivity in site-specific ways in a safe, disciplined and cost-effective manner.\n","Intelligent Warehouse Automation\n","Our intelligent warehouse automation includes deployments of autonomous robots and collaborative robots (“cobots”), automated sortation systems, automated guided vehicles, goods-to-person\n","systems and wearable devices — these are all effective ways to deliver critical improvements in speed, accuracy and productivity. Importantly, automation also enhances safety and the overall quality\n","of employment. Our warehouse management system creates a synchronized environment across automation platforms to control these technologies holistically, providing an integrated solution.\n","We have found that autonomous goods-to-person systems and cobots, which assist workers with the inventory picking process, can improve labor productivity. Stationary robot arms can repeat\n","demanding tasks with greater precision than is possible manually. Robots are particularly valuable in markets with labor shortages and where wage inflation can erode customer margins.\n","Other technologies that differentiate our logistics environments are our proprietary warehouse module for order management, which gives customers deep visibility into fulfillment flows, and our\n","analytics dashboard, which gives customers valuable business intelligence to manage their supply chains. Our connection management software module facilitates integration with SAP, Oracle and\n","other external systems, enabling our customers to get the maximum benefit from our technology.\n","Predictive Analytics\n","Our predictive analytics add significant value for customers, particularly in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, where seasonality drives high volumes through outbound and inbound logistics\n","processes. For example, up to 30% of consumer goods bought online are returned, and this creates increased volumes at certain times of the year. We have developed analytics that predict surges in\n","demand using a combination of historical data and customer forecasting.\n","As an industry leader that invests substantially in technology, we have access to an immense amount of data, as well as the analytical processing capabilities to capitalize on that data by incorporating\n","our learnings into customer solutions. We believe our ability to process and act upon data is a key competitive advantage and differentiator.\n","2\n","Customers and Markets\n","We provide our customers with high-value-added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services. We provide services to customers\n","globally, including Fortune 100 companies in the U.S., Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, European multinational market leaders and other renowned global brands. The customers we\n","serve are primarily in North America and Europe and operate in every major industry. The diversification of our customer base reduces concentration risk. In 2023, our top five customers combined\n","accounted for approximately 17% of our total revenue, and no customer represented more than 4%.\n","Our revenue is highly diversified due to our expertise across multiple verticals, reflecting our customers’ principal industry sectors. In 2023, 42% of our revenue was from Omnichannel retail, 15%\n","from Technology and consumer electronics, 14% from Food and beverage, 11% from Industrial and manufacturing, 11% from Consumer packaged goods, and 7% from other industries, with the vast\n","majority of our revenue generated in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Italy.\n","Seasonality\n","During the fourth quarter, our business benefits from strong positioning in the e-commerce sector, where demand is characterized by surges in activity associated with the holiday season. Our revenue\n","and profitability are typically lower in the first quarter of the calendar year relative to other quarters. This is due in part to seasonality, namely the post-holiday reduction in demand experienced by\n","many of our customers, which leads to less use of the logistics services we provide.\n","Competition\n","We operate in a highly competitive global industry with a highly fragmented marketplace where thousands of companies compete domestically and internationally. We compete based on our ability to\n","deliver quality service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities, expertise and pricing.\n","Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies that offer services similar to those we provide. Our competitors include CEVA, DHL, DSV, GEODIS, ID Logistics,\n","Kuehne + Nagel and Ryder. Due to the competitive nature of our marketplace, we strive daily to strengthen and expand existing business relationships and forge new relationships.\n","Government Regulations\n","Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the U.S. at the local, state, and federal levels and in other countries where we conduct business. These regulations\n","impact us directly and indirectly when they regulate third parties with which we arrange or contract services. In addition, we are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations,\n","including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes.\n","Environmental Sustainability\n","Environmental sustainability is a key pillar of our Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) strategy. We are partnering with customers around the globe to help them achieve their\n","environmental goals while we innovate to reduce our impact. For many of our customers, the logistics component of their supply chain accounts for a sizeable portion of their greenhouse gas\n","(“GHG”) emissions and waste footprint. We collaborate with customers to create action plans that reduce emissions related to their supply chains through technology-enabled solutions.\n","Our environmental sustainability strategy is designed to be applicable globally while also compliant with local environmental regulations. Throughout our business, GXO has identified GHG\n","emissions and waste associated with operations as our greatest opportunities to reduce our environmental impact. In 2021, we established environmental\n","3\n","targets to track and prioritize our reduction of Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions and increase waste diversion rates globally. Part of our environmental strategy focuses on improving the energy\n","efficiency of our buildings. We have a global initiative to replace our warehouse lighting with LED and are developing our strategy to increase the amount of renewable electricity used in our\n","buildings.\n","In 2023, we began an exercise to quantify our full carbon footprint, including our Scope 3 emissions. We anticipate the results of this exercise in the first half of 2024.\n","Human Capital\n","Our success relies in large part on our robust governance structure and Code of Business Ethics, our corporate citizenship and engaged employees who embrace our values. As a customer-centric\n","company with a strong service culture, we constantly work to maintain and improve our position as an employer of choice. This requires an unwavering commitment to workplace inclusion and\n","safety as well as competitive total compensation that meets the needs of our employees and their families.\n","Employee Profile\n","As of December 31, 2023, we operated in 27 countries with approximately 131,000 team members (comprising approximately 87,000 full-time and part-time employees and 44,000 temporary\n","workers engaged through third-party agencies). Our workforce is located: 47% in the United Kingdom, 25% in Europe (excluding the United Kingdom), 25% in North America and 3% in Latin\n","America and Asia combined. The majority of our employees in Europe and the United Kingdom were covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our employees in North America\n","were covered by collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 36% of our global workforce were women, and 66% of our workforce in the U.S. were ethnic minorities.\n","We have made and continue to make significant investments in the safety, well-being and satisfaction of our employees in numerous areas, including diversity, inclusion and belonging; health and\n","safety; talent development and engagement; and expansive total rewards.\n","Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging\n","We take pride in having an inclusive workplace that encourages a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives and mandates fair treatment for all individuals. These attributes of our culture make us a\n","stronger organization and a better partner to all GXO stakeholders. We welcome employees of every gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, life experience,\n","veteran status and disability.\n","Health and Safety\n","Our employees’ safety is always our foremost priority, and we have numerous protocols in place to ensure a safe workplace environment. We aim to maintain an Occupational Safety and Health\n","Administration recordable incident rate that is less than half the published rate for the General Warehousing and Storage sector, based on the “Industry Injury and Illness Data” of the U.S. Bureau of\n","Labor Statistics.\n","Talent Development and Engagement\n","Our employees are critically important to our ability to provide best-in-class service. We ask our employees for feedback through engagement surveys, roundtables and town halls. We use periodic\n","engagement surveys to gauge our progress and assess satisfaction. In this way, our employees help drive the continuous improvement of our business. We seek to identify top talent in all aspects of\n","the recruitment process and we emphasize training and development supported by our own online GXO University.\n","We tailor our recruitment efforts by geography and job function, using an array of channels to ensure a diverse candidate pool. Our talent development infrastructure provides resources to employees\n","who aspire to grow\n","4\n","throughout their careers, such as tailored skills development, training and mentoring. In addition, we maintain a robust pipeline of future operations leaders by using structured sponsorships and\n","additional learning techniques to develop internal candidates who demonstrate high potential to advance from supervisory roles into site leader positions. Our programs also retain top talent by\n","defining personalized development paths and attract new talent by differentiating GXO as an employer of choice.\n","Expansive Total Rewards\n","We offer a competitive compensation package to help attract and retain outstanding talent. We offer competitive wages and a comprehensive suite of benefits to all employees to maintain our position\n","as an employer of choice in the talent marketplace. A number of the benefits we offer were introduced in response to employee feedback — in the U.S., examples include our pregnancy care policy,\n","family bonding policy, tuition reimbursement program for continuing education, and benefits such as diabetes management, supplemental insurance and short-term loans. In Europe, the benefits\n","offered vary by country and are tailored to the needs of the local markets. Examples include comprehensive healthcare and risk insurance, employee assistance programs covering mental, physical\n","and financial well-being, pension plans, profit sharing and local and global bonuses structured to offer competitive pay in each country.\n","Information About Our Executive Officers\n","The following information relates to our current executive officers:\n","Name\n","Age\n","Position\n","Malcolm Wilson\n","65\n","Chief Executive Officer\n","Baris Oran\n","50\n","Chief Financial Officer\n","Karlis Kirsis\n","44\n","Chief Legal Officer\n","Elizabeth Fogarty\n","54\n","Chief Communications Officer\n","Richard Cawston\n","50\n","Chief Revenue Officer\n","Malcolm Wilson has served as Chief Executive Officer since the Separation in August 2021, after serving as Chief Executive Officer of XPO Logistics Europe since September 2017.

Reports filed with the SEC can be viewed at http://www.sec.gov and on our\n","corporate website at www.gxo.com. Materials are available online as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically submit them to the SEC.

Risk Factors.\n","The following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations,\n","including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report or our other filings with the SEC or in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to\n","the public. You should carefully consider the following factors in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and our\n","Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8.\n","Risks Related to Our Business\n","Risks Related to Our Strategy and Operations\n","We operate in a highly competitive industry, and failure to compete or respond to customer requirements could negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\n","The logistics industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. We compete against multinational firms, regional players and emerging technology companies.\n","We also must contend with our customers’ ability to in-source their logistics operations. The competitive factors that are most important to our customers are price and quality of service. Many larger\n","customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers. Customers regularly solicit bids from competitors to improve service and to secure favorable pricing and contractual terms such as longer\n","payment terms, fixed-price arrangements, higher or unlimited liability and performance penalties. Increased competition and competitors’ acceptance of more onerous contractual terms could result in\n","reduced revenues, reduced margins, higher operating costs or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","Increases in our labor costs to attract, develop and retain employees may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n","Our workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. To grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a\n","large number of hourly employees while controlling labor costs. Many of our long-term customer contracts are fixed-price arrangements that limit our ability to pass on to our customers increases in\n","labor costs due to low unemployment, increases in government unemployment benefits, competitive pressures, union activity or changes in federal or state minimum wage or overtime laws and any\n","such increases in labor costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","Additionally, our operations are subject to various employment-related laws and regulations, which govern matters such as minimum wages, union organizing rights, the classification of employees\n","and independent contractors, family and medical leave, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions and a variety of similar laws that govern these and other\n","employment-related matters. Any changes to employment-related laws and regulations, including increased minimum wages or the expansion of union organization rights, could result in increased\n","labor costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","6\n","Labor represents a significant portion of our operating expenses, thus, compliance with these evolving laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business, while failure to do\n","so could subject us to significant fines and lawsuits and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are currently subject to employment-related\n","claims in connection with our operations. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings are in various stages of adjudication or investigation and involve a wide variety of claims and potential outcomes.\n","We depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and temporary workers.\n","We depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, including our executive officers and managers. If we are unable to attract and retain such individuals, we may be unable to maintain\n","our current competitive position within the industry, meet our customers’ expectations or successfully expand and grow our business.\n","Our ability to meet customer demands and expectations, especially during periods of peak volume, is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit and retain qualified temporary part-time and full-\n","time workers. Increased demand for temporary workers, low unemployment or changes in federal or state minimum wage laws may increase the costs of temporary labor, and any such increases in\n","labor costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting actions, as well as other macro-economic\n","headwinds such as inflation and supply change disruptions increased the potential for labor shortages and heightened levels of employee turnover. Therefore, our inability to recruit a qualified\n","temporary workforce may result in our inability to meet our customers’ performance targets.\n","Our past acquisitions, as well as any acquisitions that we may complete in the future, may be unsuccessful or result in other risks or developments that adversely affect our financial condition\n","and results.\n","While we intend for our acquisitions to improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our\n","operational or strategic expectations. Special risks, including accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology or human resources issues may arise in connection with, or as a result of, the\n","acquisition of an existing company, including the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, possible management distractions or the\n","inability of the acquired business to achieve the levels of revenue, income, productivity or synergies we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect on the timeline contemplated. We are unable to\n","predict all the risks that could arise as a result of our acquisitions.\n","If the performance of an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or if estimates about the future profitability of an acquired business change, our revenues, earnings or other\n","aspects of our financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also experience difficulties in connection with integrating any acquired companies into our existing businesses and operations,\n","including our existing infrastructure and information technology systems. The infrastructure and information technology systems of acquired companies could present issues that we were unable to\n","identify prior to the acquisition and could adversely affect our financial condition and results. We have experienced challenges of this nature relating to the infrastructure and systems of certain\n","companies that we have acquired. Also, we may not realize all of the synergies we anticipate from past and potential future acquisitions. Among the synergies that we currently expect to realize are\n","cross-selling opportunities to our existing customers, as well as network and operational efficiencies. Variances from these or other assumptions or expectations could adversely affect our financial\n","condition and results of operations.\n","We may not successfully manage our growth.\n","We have grown rapidly and substantially over prior years, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions and entering new markets and we intend to continue to focus on rapid\n","growth, including organic growth and additional acquisitions. We may experience difficulties and higher than expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new\n","markets, changes in revenue and business models, entry into new geographic areas or increased pressure on our existing infrastructure and information technology systems.\n","7\n","Our growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational, financial and information technology resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls, as\n","well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems and procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will continue\n","to increase as our operations grow. Failure to manage our growth effectively or obtain necessary working capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows\n","and financial condition.\n","Our overseas operations are subject to various operational and financial risks that could adversely affect our business.\n","The services we provide outside the U.S. are subject to risks resulting from changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, tax rules and policies, difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign\n","operations and agents, different liability standards, issues related to compliance with anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, data protection, trade\n","compliance and intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights relating to our intellectual property, including our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as U.S. laws.\n","The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region. In addition, as we expand\n","our business in foreign countries, we will be exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls.\n","We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because a significant proportion of our assets, liabilities and earnings are denominated in foreign currencies.\n","We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars (“USD”), but we hold a significant proportion of our net assets and generate income in non-USD currencies, primarily the Euro and British pound\n","sterling. Consequently, a depreciation of non-USD currencies relative to the USD could have an adverse impact on our financial results as further discussed in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative\n","Disclosures about Market Risk.”\n","National and regional differences in monetary policy may cause the value of the non-USD currencies to fluctuate against the USD. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our revenue and\n","expenses in foreign currency jurisdictions. Accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n","Our inability to successfully manage the costs and operational difficulties of adding new customers and business may negatively affect our financial condition and operations.\n","Establishing new customer relationships or adding operational sites for existing customers requires a significant amount of time, operational focus and capital. Although we typically partner with our\n","new customers to ensure that onboarding is smooth, our inability to integrate new customers or operational sites into our technology systems or recruit additional employees to manage new customer\n","relationships or the incurrence of higher than anticipated costs to onboard new customers may negatively affect our financial condition or operations.\n","In addition, our operations can require a significant commitment of capital in the form of shelving, racking and other warehousing systems that may be necessary to implement warehouse solutions\n","for our customers. These costs are often billed to the customer over the expected length of the customer relationship. To the extent that a customer defaults on its obligations under its agreement with\n","us, we could be forced to take a significant loss on the unrecovered portion of the upfront capital costs.\n","The contractual terms between us and our customers could expose us to penalties and other costs in the event we do not meet the contractually prescribed performance levels.\n","We maintain long-term contracts with the majority of our customers, many of which include performance-based minimum levels of service. Although we manage our business to exceed prescribed\n","performance levels, our inability to meet these service levels, whether due to labor shortages, volume peaks, our inability to procure temporary labor,\n","8\n","technological malfunctions or other events that may or may not be within our control, may expose us to penalties or incremental costs or lead to the termination of customer contracts, any of which\n","could negatively affect our business and financial condition.\n","Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, and our inability to manage these fluctuations could negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\n","Many of our customers typically realize a significant portion of their sales during the holiday season in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Although not all of our customers experience the same\n","seasonal variation, and some customers may have seasonal peaks that occur in periods other than the fourth quarter, the seasonality of our customers’ businesses places higher demands on our\n","services during peak periods, requiring us to take measures, including temporarily expanding our workforce, to meet our customers’ demands. Our failure to meet our customers’ expectations during\n","these seasonal peaks may negatively affect our customer relationships, could expose us to penalties under our contractual arrangements with customers and ultimately could negatively affect our\n","business and our results of operations.\n","Damage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity or the actions of our employees or temporary workers could adversely affect our financial condition.\n","Our success depends on our ability to consistently deliver operational excellence and strong customer service. Our inability to deliver our services and solutions as promised on a consistent basis, or\n","our customers having a negative experience or otherwise becoming dissatisfied, can negatively impact our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation,\n","which could, in turn, adversely affect revenue and earnings growth. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees, contractors, agents or others with whom we do\n","business, such as customer service issues, could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter),\n","Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. This unfavorable publicity could also\n","require us to allocate significant resources to rebuild our reputation.\n","We face risks associated with the handling of customer inventory.\n","Under some of our agreements, we maintain the inventory of our customers, some of which may be significant in value. Our failure to properly handle and safeguard such inventory exposes us to\n","potential claims and expenses as well as harm to our business and reputation.\n","Risks Related to Our Use of Technology\n","Our business will be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate our information technology systems, including the systems of any\n","businesses that we acquire.\n","We rely heavily on our information technology systems in managing our business; they are a key component of our customer-facing services and internal growth strategy. In general, we expect our\n","customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated technology. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly address market trends and\n","enhance the features and functionality of our proprietary technology platform in response to these trends. This process of continuous enhancement may lead to significant ongoing software\n","development costs, which will continue to increase if we pursue new acquisitions of companies and their current systems. In addition, we may fail to accurately determine the needs of our customers\n","or trends in the logistics industry, or we may fail to respond appropriately by implementing functionality for our technology platform in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any such failures could\n","result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues.\n","If our information technology systems are unable to manage high volumes with reliability, accuracy and speed as we grow, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various services we offer,\n","our service levels and operating\n","9\n","efficiency could decline. In addition, if we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect and maintain our information technology systems, or if we fail to enhance our systems to\n","meet our customers’ needs, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n","Our technology may not be successful or may not achieve the desired results, and we may require additional training or different personnel to successfully implement this technology. Our technology\n","development process may be subject to cost overruns or delays in obtaining the expected results, which may result in disruptions to our operations. Technology and new market entrants may also\n","disrupt the way we and our competitors operate.\n","If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, if our technology does not provide the anticipated benefits or it does not meet market demands, we may be placed at a competitive\n","disadvantage and could lose customers, materially adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\n","A failure of our information technology infrastructure or a breach of our information systems, networks or processes may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n","The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, including internet and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business. We also rely on\n","third parties and virtualized infrastructure to operate our information technology systems. Despite significant testing for risk management, external and internal risks, such as malware, insecure\n","coding, “Acts of God,” data leakage and human error pose a direct threat to the stability or effectiveness of our information technology systems and operations. The failure of our information\n","technology systems to perform as we anticipate could adversely affect our business through transaction errors, billing and invoicing errors, internal recordkeeping and reporting errors, processing\n","inefficiencies and loss of sales, receivables collection or customers. Any such failure could result in harm to our reputation and have an ongoing adverse impact on our business, results of operations\n","and financial condition, including after the underlying failures have been remedied.\n","We may also be subject to cyberattacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyberattack could result in service interruptions,\n","operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liabilities to our customers or others, the diversion of corporate resources, injury to our reputation or increased service and maintenance costs.\n","Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to the resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. In addition, recently, regulatory and\n","enforcement focus on data protection has heightened in the U.S. and abroad, particularly in the European Union (“EU”), and failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection\n","regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could harm our business, its reputation, results of operations and financial\n","condition.\n","Issues related to the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, whether related to our failure to enforce our own rights or infringement claims brought by others, could have a\n","material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n","We use both internally developed and purchased technologies in conducting our business. It is possible that users of these technologies, whether internally developed or purchased, could be claimed\n","to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against us by a third party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, a settlement or\n","adverse judgment against us could result in increased costs to license the technology or a legal prohibition against continued use of the technology. Thus, our failure to obtain, maintain or enforce our\n","intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n","We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to protect\n","our intellectual property and technology. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated; our trade secrets and\n","other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third parties; or we may fail to secure the rights to intellectual property developed by\n","10\n","our employees, contractors and others. Efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be time-consuming and costly, distract management’s attention, divert our resources in other ways and\n","ultimately be unsuccessful. Moreover, should we fail to develop and properly manage future intellectual property, this could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities.\n","Risks Related to Our Credit and Liquidity\n","Challenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect our future access to capital on favorable terms.\n","Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. Our ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on\n","acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our services or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or if there are other significantly unfavorable\n","changes in economic conditions.\n","We have incurred debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations.\n","Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could materially and adversely affect our\n","financial position and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with the covenants under our indebtedness may have a material adverse impact on our operations. If we fail to comply with any\n","of the covenants under our debt obligations and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, such failure may result in an event of default under our indebtedness. We may not have sufficient\n","liquidity to repay or refinance our indebtedness if such indebtedness were accelerated upon an event of default. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future.\n","Risks Related to Third-Party Relationships\n","Our business may be materially adversely affected by labor disputes or organizing efforts.\n","Labor disputes involving our customers could affect our operations. If our customers experience plant slowdowns or closures because they are unable to negotiate labor contracts, our revenue and\n","profitability could be negatively impacted. In particular, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the operation and management of facilities that are often located close to a customer’s\n","manufacturing plant and are integrated into the customer’s production line process. If any of our customers are affected by labor disputes and consequently cease or significantly modify their\n","operations at a plant served by us, we may experience significant revenue loss and shutdown costs, including costs related to early termination of leases.\n","In Europe, our business activities rely on a large amount of labor, including a number of workers who are affiliated with trade unions and other staff representative institutions. A deteriorating\n","economic environment may result in tensions in industrial relations, which may lead to industrial action within our European operations which could have a direct impact on our business operations.\n","Generally, any deterioration in industrial relations in our European operations, such as general strike activities or other material labor disputes, could have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings\n","and financial position.\n","Although our workforce in the U.S. is not unionized, labor unions have, from time to time, attempted to organize our employees. Successful unionization of our employees or organizing efforts could\n","lead to business interruptions, work stoppages and the reduction of service levels due to work rules and could have an adverse effect on our customer relationships and our revenues, earnings and\n","financial position.\n","11\n","Any failure to properly manage our temporary workers could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, earnings and financial position.\n","Our business uses a large number of temporary workers in our operations. We cannot guarantee that temporary workers are as well-trained as our other employees. Specifically, we may be exposed to\n","the risk that temporary workers may not perform their assignments in a satisfactory manner or may not comply with our safety rules in an appropriate manner, whether as a result of their lack of\n","experience or otherwise. If such risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n","Risks Related to Litigation and Regulations\n","We may be involved in lawsuits and are subject to various claims that could result in significant expenditures and impact our operations.\n","The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various types of claims and litigation. We are subject to claims and litigation related to our customer contracts and relationships, labor and\n","employment, personal injury, vehicular accidents, cargo and other property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters, including claims asserted under various other\n","theories of agency or employer liability. Claims against us may exceed the amount of insurance coverage that we have or may not be covered by insurance at all. Businesses that we acquire also\n","increase our exposure to litigation. Material increases in liability claims or workers’ compensation claims, the unfavorable resolution of claims or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under\n","indemnity provisions could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims\n","could affect our earnings.\n","We are subject to risks associated with a defined benefit plan for our current and former employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial position.\n","We maintain a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. A decline in interest rates or lower returns on funded plan assets may cause increases in the expense and funding requirements for this plan.\n","Despite past amendments that froze our defined benefit pension plan to new participants and curtailed benefits, this pension plan remains subject to volatility associated with interest rates, inflation,\n","returns on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions and statutory funding requirements. Any of these factors could lead to a significant increase in the expense of this plan and a deterioration in the\n","solvency of the plan, which could significantly increase our contribution requirements. As a result, we are unable to predict the effect on our financial statements associated with our defined benefit\n","pension plan.\n","Changes in tax laws and regulations for U.S. and multinational companies may increase our tax liability.\n","The U.S. Congress, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), the EU and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates do business have\n","maintained a focus on the taxation of multinational companies. During 2023, the OECD issued administrative guidance for the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion rules (“Pillar Two”), which\n","generally imposes a 15% global minimum tax on multinational companies. Many Pillar Two rules are effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2024, with other aspects to be effective from\n","2025. The Company regularly monitors developments in its jurisdictions and considers the impact of the tax-related proposals as they arise.\n","We are subject to regulations, which could negatively impact our business.\n","Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies at the local, state and federal levels in the U.S. and in the foreign countries where we operate. These regulatory agencies\n","have authority and oversight of domestic and international activities. Our subsidiaries must also comply with applicable regulations and requirements of various agencies.\n","12\n","The regulatory landscape in which we operate is constantly evolving and subject to significant change, including as a result of evolving political and social pressures. Future laws, regulations and\n","regulatory reforms may be more stringent and may require changes to our operating practices that influence the demand for our services or require us to incur significant additional costs. We are\n","unable to predict the impact that recently enacted and future regulations may have on our business. If higher costs are incurred by us as a result of future changes in regulations, this could adversely\n","affect our results of operations to the extent we are unable to obtain a corresponding increase in price from our customers.\n","Proposed or pending legislative or regulatory changes, or future legislative or regulatory changes, at the federal, state or local level may decrease demand for our services, increase our costs,\n","including our labor costs, and negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\n","Our business is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, including but not limited to changes that would encourage workers to unionize, make it easier for\n","workers to collectively bargain, increase operational requirements on our business or mandate certain restrictions on the terms of employment for individual workers, including how often they can\n","work or how long they can work in any individual shift. Any and all of these changes or other similar changes could have significant implications for our business model, including increasing our\n","labor costs, reducing our operational flexibility and restricting our ability to meet our customers’ expectations and demands, any of which could negatively affect our business and our results of\n","operations. If such regulations are adopted, they could increase our cost of operations or hinder our ability to meet our customers’ expectations and demands, either of which would negatively affect\n","our business and our results of operations.\n","Additionally, significant regulatory changes at the federal, state or local level may negatively affect economic output, cause growth to slow, reduce consumer spending and sentiment and result in\n","decreased demand for our services, negatively affecting our business and our results of operations.\n","Economic recessions and other factors, such as heightened geopolitical tensions or conflict, that reduce consumer spending, both in North America and Europe, could have a material adverse\n","impact on our business.\n","Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers’ business cycles and changes in customers’ business practices. Our customers experience cyclical fluctuations\n","in demand for their products due to economic recessions, which reduces the demand for our services and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","The ramifications of any period of heightened geopolitical tensions or conflicts, including increased international trade sanctions, may negatively impact regional and global economic markets,\n","including where we operate, may cause supply chain disruptions and may increase costs for labor, transportation and energy. Any period of heightened geopolitical tensions or conflict can increase\n","financial market volatility and could negatively affect our ability to raise additional capital when required. While we do not conduct business in Russia, the conflict and its effects could adversely\n","affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","Risks Related to Environmental, Social and Governance\n","Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\n","Our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing discharges of\n","pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. The operation of our businesses entails risks under\n","environmental laws and regulations. For example, certain jurisdictions including the State of California enacted legislation requiring certain companies to disclose GHG emissions and climate-related\n","financial risk information. We could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations\n","of or liabilities under these laws and regulations. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to\n","13\n","comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\n","Our ability to achieve our ESG goals is subject to risks, many of which are outside our control, and our reputation could be harmed if we fail to meet such goals.\n","Our ability to achieve our ESG goals, including our goal to achieve 30% reduction in Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2030, and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents\n","numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks and may be dependent on the actions of suppliers and other third parties, all of which are outside our control. If we are unable to meet our ESG\n","goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, our reputation could be negatively impacted. If, as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices, certain investors are unsatisfied\n","with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company. If the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have\n","to undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics. Any failure or perceived failure to satisfy various ESG reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could\n","increase the risk of litigation.\n","Risks Related to the Separation\n","If the Separation, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax\n","liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify XPO for material amounts of taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax\n","Matters Agreement by and between XPO and GXO (the “TMA”).\n","In connection with the Separation, XPO received an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the Separation under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code\n","(the “Code”). The opinion of counsel was based upon and relies on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of XPO.\n","Notwithstanding the receipt of the opinion of counsel, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that the Separation and/or certain related transactions should be treated as\n","taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have\n","been violated.\n","If the Separation, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D)\n","of the Code, XPO would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the GXO common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and XPO stockholders who receive such GXO shares in the\n","distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\n","In addition, as part of and before the Separation, XPO and its subsidiaries completed an internal reorganization, and XPO, GXO and their respective subsidiaries incurred certain tax costs in\n","connection with the internal reorganization, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from transactions in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. With respect to certain transactions undertaken\n","as part of the internal reorganization, XPO obtained opinions of external tax advisors regarding the tax treatment of such transactions. If any of these representations or statements is, or becomes,\n","inaccurate or incomplete, or if XPO, GXO or their respective subsidiaries do not fulfill or otherwise comply with any such undertakings or covenants, such opinions may be invalid or the conclusions\n","reached therein could be jeopardized. Further, notwithstanding receipt of any such tax opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of\n","the relevant transactions differs from the conclusions reached in the relevant tax opinions. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant transaction,\n","XPO, GXO and their subsidiaries could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\n","14\n","Risks Related to Our Common Stock\n","Any stockholder’s percentage of ownership in GXO may be diluted in the future at any given time.\n","In the future, existing holders of our common stock may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including any equity awards that we will\n","grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have stock-based awards that correspond to shares of our common stock after the Separation as a result of the conversion of their XPO\n","stock-based awards. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors has granted and is likely to continue to grant additional stock-based awards to our employees under our\n","employee benefits plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on the number of GXO shares outstanding and therefore on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of\n","our common stock.\n","Certain provisions in GXO’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of GXO, which could\n","decrease the trading price of GXO’s common stock.\n","Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and\n","inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a\n","hostile takeover. These provisions include:\n","•\n","the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n","•\n","limitations on stockholders’ ability to call a special stockholder meeting or act by written consent;\n","•\n","rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and\n","•\n","the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\n","In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (the “DGCL”), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. Section 203 provides that,\n","subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business\n","combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates\n","become the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock.\n","We believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing\n","our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make GXO immune from takeovers; however, these provisions will apply even if the\n","offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of GXO and our stockholders.\n","These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\n","In addition, in certain circumstances an acquisition or further issuance of our stock may trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, causing the Separation to be taxable to XPO. Under the\n","TMA, we are required to indemnify XPO for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.\n","GXO’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision that may discourage lawsuits against GXO and GXO’s directors and officers.\n","Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within\n","the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of GXO,\n","any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a\n","15\n","fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer of GXO to GXO or to GXO stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, any\n","action asserting a claim against GXO or any current or former director or officer of GXO arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or\n","amended and restated bylaws, any action asserting a claim relating to or involving GXO governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is\n","defined in Section 115 of the DGCL.\n","To the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act and the\n","Exchange Act, although GXO stockholders will not be deemed to have waived GXO’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n","This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with GXO or our directors or officers,\n","which may discourage such lawsuits against GXO or our directors or officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one\n","or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our\n","business, results of operations and financial condition.\n","Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n","None.\n","Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n","We believe that cybersecurity is fundamental to how we operate and as such we focus on defining and managing our cybersecurity risk. With the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape and continual\n","emergence of new threats, our Board of Directors, Audit Committee and senior management team ensure that significant resources are devoted to cybersecurity risk management and the technologies,\n","processes and people that support it. We have an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, comprising senior leaders from key functions, and a Cybersecurity Risk Committee which utilize the\n","National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) framework to ensure that these risks are clearly and effectively categorized and treated.\n","We utilize comprehensive and widespread information sources and services (including third-party threat intelligence) to understand the threat landscape faced by the Company and design our\n","protective controls accordingly using a defense-in-depth approach. The layers of these defenses are aligned to the NIST framework; Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. The Enterprise\n","Risk Management Committee and Cybersecurity Risk Management Committee meet regularly to consider any change to risk levels and ensure that the Company’s cybersecurity controls remain\n","commensurate to those risk levels.\n","The Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) is responsible for developing and implementing our cybersecurity program and reporting on related matters to our Board of Directors.\n","The CISO has over a decade of experience leading cybersecurity functions and over two decades in cybersecurity. The CISO leads a global team of highly trained experts covering all major\n","cybersecurity functions including Technical Engineering and Architecture, Governance Risk and Compliance, Security Operations and Incident Response, Threat and Vulnerability Management and\n","Security Awareness. The technologies, policies and processes associated with these functions are tested by third parties at least annually to ensure continued effectiveness and identify any\n","opportunities for improvement. These tests and assessments are useful tools for maintaining a robust cybersecurity program to protect our investors, customers, employees, vendors and intellectual\n","property.\n","A full suite of cybersecurity policies exists and is applicable to all employees globally. These policies are reviewed annually and approved by relevant senior leaders. All Company employees are\n","required to complete cybersecurity training annually, with quarterly “refreshers” throughout the year.\n","16\n","We invest in our cybersecurity defenses and have implemented multiple layers of protection against all known critical threats. We have high levels of compliance to protective controls on our\n","technical estate, robust perimeter defenses, industry-leading filtering and analysis of web and email traffic, widespread multi-factor authentication, continuous training of our employees through\n","educational material or simulation (e.g., phishing) and 24/7 monitoring of the IT estate. We have our own “red team” that is always searching our own environment for signs of vulnerability and have\n","a well-defined Cyber Incident Response Plan (“CIRP”) that is performed as a table-top exercise at least annually. A range of dashboards has been designed for use by the cybersecurity management\n","team to monitor the day-to-day performance of the cybersecurity defenses and immediately remediate any sign of concern.\n","All third-party vendors utilized by GXO undergo a cybersecurity assessment at the time of engagement. This assessment scrutinizes the third party’s cybersecurity maturity to ascertain the level of\n","risk the third party may present to the systems and data of GXO and its customers.\n","Our Audit Committee and our Board of Directors actively participate in discussions with management and among themselves regarding cybersecurity risks. In addition, our Board receives regular\n","cybersecurity reports, which include a review of key performance and risk indicators, test results and related remediation and recent threats and how the Company is managing those threats.\n","Despite the continuous risk faced by the Company, we have suffered no incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business\n","strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, nor have we had any widespread intrusion or incident. Notwithstanding the exhaustive approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be\n","successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. While GXO maintains\n","cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of cybersecurity risks.\n","Item 2.

Our customers rely on us to move their goods with high efficiency through their supply chains — from the moment goods arrive at our warehouses\n","through fulfillment and distribution, and the management of returned products. Our customer base includes many blue-chip leaders in sectors that demonstrate high growth and/or durable demand,\n","with significant growth potential through customer outsourcing of logistics services.\n","We strive to provide all customers with consistent quality service and cutting-edge automation. We also collaborate with our largest customers on planning and forecasting and assist with network\n","optimization, working with these customers to design or redesign their supply chains to meet specific goals, such as environmental, social and governance. Our multidisciplinary, consultative\n","approach has led to many of our key customer relationships extending for years and expanding in scope.\n","The most dramatic growth in demand in recent years has been in e-commerce and related sectors, including omnichannel retail and other direct-to-consumer channels. We expect to attract new\n","customers and expand the services we provide to existing customers through new projects, thus earning more of their logistics spending. We use technology to manage advanced automation, labor\n","productivity, sustainability, safety and the complex flow of goods within sophisticated warehouse environments.\n","Our business model is asset-light and historically resilient in cycles, with high returns, strong free cash flow and visibility into revenue and earnings. The vast majority of our contracts with customers\n","are long-term in nature, and our warehouse lease arrangements generally align with contract length. The Company has both fixed-price contracts (closed book or hybrid contracts) and cost-plus\n","contracts (open book contracts). Most of our customer contracts contain both fixed and variable components. The fixed component is typically designed to cover warehouse, technology and\n","equipment costs, while the variable component is determined based on expected volumes and associated labor costs. Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work\n","for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company’s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, the Company will generate more or less profit. Cost-plus contracts\n","provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during the performance of the contract plus a specified margin.\n","20\n","Basis of Presentation\n","On August 2, 2021, the Company became a standalone publicly traded company and its financial statements post the separation from XPO, Inc. (the “Separation”) are now prepared on a consolidated\n","basis. Before the Separation, GXO’s historical financial statements were prepared on a standalone combined basis and were derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting\n","records of XPO. The combined Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented before the Separation are now referred to as “Consolidated Financial Statements” and have been prepared\n","under the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). GXO has one reportable segment.\n","On October 23, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of PFSweb, Inc. (“PFS”), an e-commerce order fulfillment company based in Irving, Texas (the “PFS Acquisition”). On May 24, 2022,\n","the Company completed the acquisition of Clipper Logistics plc (“Clipper”), an omnichannel retail logistics specialist based in Leeds, England (the “Clipper Acquisition”). Due to the acquisitions of\n","Clipper and PFS, comparisons in our results of operations between 2023 and 2022 are less meaningful.\n","Results of Operations\n","Year Ended December 31,\n","(In millions)\n","2023\n","2022\n","$ Change\n","% Change\n","Revenue\n","$\n","9,778 \n","$\n","8,993 \n","$\n","785 \n","9 %\n","Direct operating expense\n","8,035 \n","7,443 \n","592 \n","8 %\n","Selling, general and administrative expense\n","998 \n","886 \n","112 \n","13 %\n","Depreciation and amortization expense\n","361 \n","329 \n","32 \n","10 %\n","Transaction and integration costs\n","34 \n","61 \n","(27)\n","(44)%\n","Restructuring costs and other\n","32 \n","32 \n","— \n","— %\n","Operating income\n","318 \n","242 \n","76 \n","31 %\n","Other income, net\n","1 \n","51 \n","(50)\n","(98)%\n","Interest expense, net\n","(53)\n","(29)\n","(24)\n","83 %\n","Income before income taxes\n","266 \n","264 \n","2 \n","1 %\n","Income tax expense\n","(33)\n","(64)\n","31 \n","48 %\n","Net income\n","$\n","233 \n","$\n","200 \n","$\n","33 \n","17 %\n","Revenue for 2023 increased by 9%, or $785 million, to $9.8 billion compared with $9.0 billion for 2022.

See Note 9. “Debt and Financing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\n","information.\n","In addition, we have obligations for agreements to purchase goods or services entered into in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and gross unrecognized tax\n","benefits.\n","Critical Accounting Policies\n","We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. We make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,\n","expenses, gains and losses. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations. We have identified the following\n","accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their\n","application.\n","Business Combinations\n","We record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to\n","tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable\n","assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill.\n","Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities\n","assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful\n","lives of those acquired intangible assets. Significant assumptions utilized in the allocation of the purchase price related to intangible assets include future expected cash flows from acquired\n","intangibles and discount rates.\n","Our estimates of fair value are based upon reasonable assumptions but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from these estimates. During the\n","measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the\n","conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. See Note 4. “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n","Evaluation of Goodwill\n","We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or\n","one level below, on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying\n","value. We have three reporting units: i) Americas and Asia-Pacific, ii) United Kingdom and Ireland and iii) Continental Europe.\n","For each reporting unit, we first assess qualitative factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a\n","quantitative goodwill impairment test.\n","25\n","The qualitative factors could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a\n","reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\n","A quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, includes estimating the fair value of a reporting unit using the income and/or market approach. The income approach of determining fair\n","value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which requires us to make various assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth\n","rates and discount rates. The discount rates reflect management’s judgment and are based on a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of businesses similar to the\n","reporting units. Inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital\n","and tax rates. Our forecasts also reflect expectations concerning future economic conditions, interest rates and other market data. The market approach of determining fair value is based on\n","comparable market multiples for companies engaged in similar businesses, as well as recent transactions within our industry. We believe using these valuation techniques yields the most appropriate\n","evidence of the reporting unit’s fair value.\n","Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could\n","materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of any potential impairment.\n","Employee Benefit Plans\n","We sponsor various retirement plans, the most significant of which is in the U.K. (the “U.K. Retirement Plan”). Assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the\n","discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year at December 31. A change in any\n","of these assumptions would have an effect on the net periodic pension cost reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high-quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as\n","determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. A 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate of the U.K. Retirement Plan would result in an estimated increase in the accumulated benefit\n","obligation of approximately $44 million. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical\n","as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. An increase or decrease of 50 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return of the U.K. Retirement Plan would have decreased or\n","increased 2023 net periodic pension cost by approximately $4 million. See Note 14. “Employee Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n","New Accounting Standards\n","Information related to new accounting standards is included in Note 2. “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","26\n","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n","Our market risk disclosures involve forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. We are exposed to market risk related\n","to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\n","Interest Rate Risk\n","Our long-term debt portfolio, excluding finance leases and other debt, consists of $800 million fixed-rate notes and $735 million variable-rate loans, complemented by a variable-rate revolving credit\n","facility. We use cross-currency swap agreements to convert $250 million of variable-rate debt from Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) to Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“Euribor”). We also\n","entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert $250 million of variable-rate U.S. dollar (“USD”)-denominated debt into USD-denominated fixed-rate debt. As of December 31, 2023, a\n","hypothetical 1% increase in Euribor would have increased our interest expense by approximately $3 million.\n","Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n","A significant proportion of our net assets and income is in non-USD currencies, primarily the Euro (“EUR”) and British pound sterling (“GBP”). We are exposed to currency risk from potential\n","changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows. Consequently, depreciation of the EUR or the GBP relative to the USD could have an\n","adverse impact on our financial results.\n","We entered into cross-currency swap agreements to manage our foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting a portion of the fixed-rate USD-denominated debt, including the interest\n","payments, to fixed-rate EUR-denominated debt and a portion of the floating-rate USD-denominated loans, including the interest payments, to floating-rate EUR-denominated debt. We use foreign\n","currency option contracts to mitigate the risk of a reduction in the value of earnings from our operations that use the EUR or GBP as their functional currency.\n","As of December 31, 2023, a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the USD relative to the EUR would have increased our net assets by approximately $67 million, net of hedging. As of\n","December 31, 2023, a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the USD relative to the GBP would have decreased our net assets by approximately $143 million, net of hedging. These theoretical\n","calculations assume that an instantaneous, parallel shift in exchange rates occurs, which is not consistent with the history of foreign currency markets. Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the\n","volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does\n","not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.\n","See Note 10. “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n","27\n","Item 8.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n","Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n","A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements\n","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\n","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\n","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\n","only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,\n","or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\n","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n","Critical Audit Matter\n","The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the\n","audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\n","The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\n","matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n","Sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue from contracts with customers\n","As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided under the terms of the Company’s contractual\n","relationship with its customers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported $9.8 billion of revenue.\n","We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue from contracts with customers (revenue) as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment and IT professionals\n","with specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue due to the number and dispersion of warehouse management and other IT\n","systems used in the processing and recording of revenue.\n","The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over\n","the processing and recording of revenue. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the processing and recording of revenue, including\n","manual controls related to the examination of revenue contracts and detection of revenues recorded outside of expectations. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to\n","test certain manual and automated controls, including general IT controls, over multiple relevant IT systems and information used in internal control. We compared certain revenue activity\n","recorded during the year to cash received, adjusted for reconciling items. We evaluated the relevance and reliability of certain reconciling items to underlying documentation, including the\n","changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. We examined a selection of revenue contracts and transactions to assess that revenue was recorded in accordance with the Company’s\n","accounting policy. Additionally, for a sample of accrued revenue at year-end, we confirmed with the Company’s customers the amount of revenue billed subsequent to year-end and compared the\n","result to the Company’s accounting records. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence\n","30\n","obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.\n","/s/

Statements.\n","37\n","GXO Logistics, Inc.\n","Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n","1. Organization\n","Nature of Operations\n","GXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“GXO” or the “Company”), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world. The Company provides its customers with high-value-\n","added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services differentiated by its ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at\n","scale. The Company serves a broad range of customers across a range of industries, such as e-commerce, omnichannel retail, technology and consumer electronics, food and beverage, industrial and\n","manufacturing, and consumer packaged goods, among others. The Company presents its operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements as one reportable segment.\n","On August 2, 2021, the Company completed the separation (the “Separation”) from XPO, Inc. (“XPO”). The Separation was accomplished by the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common\n","stock of GXO to XPO stockholders as of the close of business on July 23, 2021, the record date for the distribution. XPO stockholders received one share of GXO common stock for every share of\n","XPO common stock held at the close of business on the record date. On August 2, 2021, GXO became a standalone publicly-traded company and regular-way trading of GXO’s common stock\n","commenced on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GXO.” GXO was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2021.\n","2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n","Basis of Presentation\n","Before the Separation, the Company’s financial statements were prepared on a standalone combined basis and were derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting records of\n","XPO (the “historical financial statements”). On August 2, 2021, the Company became a standalone publicly traded company, and its financial statements post-Separation are prepared on a\n","consolidated basis. The combined Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented before the Separation are now also referred to as “Consolidated Financial Statements” and have been\n","prepared under the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n","Before the Separation, the Company’s historical assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by XPO and were reflected on a historical cost basis. In connection with the Separation, the\n","Company’s assets and liabilities were transferred to the Company on a carry-over basis.\n","Before the Separation, the historical results of operations included allocations of XPO costs and expenses including XPO’s corporate function, which incurred a variety of expenses, including, but not\n","limited to, information technology, human resources, accounting, sales and sales operations, procurement, executive services, legal, corporate finance and communications. An allocation of these\n","expenses is included to burden all business units comprising XPO’s historical results of operations, including GXO. The charges reflected have been either specifically identified or allocated using\n","drivers including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which includes adjustments for transaction and integration costs, as well as restructuring costs and other\n","adjustments, or headcount. The majority of these allocated costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense; Depreciation and amortization expense; and Transaction and\n","integration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n","The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of GXO Logistics, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where the Company is the primary\n","beneficiary. The Company has eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions.\n","38\n","Use of Estimates\n","The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the Consolidated\n","Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the\n","circumstances. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, loss contingencies,\n","defined benefit plans, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives, collectability of accounts receivable and the fair value of\n","financial instruments. Actual results may vary from those estimates.\n","Significant Accounting Policies\n","Cash, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\n","The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Bank overdraft positions occur when total\n","outstanding issued checks exceed available cash balances at a single financial institution. Restricted cash is included within Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance sheets and consists\n","primarily of cash that collateralizes certain operating obligations.\n","Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\n","Accounts receivable represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive consideration from its customers. The Company records accounts receivable at the contractual amount and records an\n","allowance for doubtful accounts for the amount it estimates it may not collect. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers historical collection experience, the age of\n","the accounts receivable balances, the credit quality and risk of its customers, any specific customer collection issues, current economic conditions and other factors that may impact its customers’\n","ability to pay. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances once the receivables are no longer deemed collectible.\n","The roll forward of the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n","Year Ended December 31,\n","(In millions)\n","2023\n","2022\n","2021\n","Beginning balance\n","$\n","12 \n","$\n","13 \n","$\n","18 \n","Provisions charged to expense\n","10 \n","5 \n","4 \n","Write-offs, less recoveries, and other adjustments\n","(11)\n","(6)\n","(9)\n","Ending balance\n","$\n","11 \n","$\n","12 \n","$\n","13 \n","Property and Equipment\n","Property and equipment, which includes assets recorded under finance leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or, in the case of property and equipment acquired in a business\n","combination, at fair value at the date of acquisition. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expenses as incurred.\n","For internally developed computer software, all costs incurred during the planning and evaluation stages are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized once the preliminary\n","project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended.\n","Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Land and assets held within construction in\n","progress are not depreciated.\n","39\n","The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below:\n","Estimated Useful Life\n","Buildings\n","40 years\n","Leasehold improvements\n","Shorter of useful life or term of lease\n","Technology and automated systems\n","3 to 15 years\n","Warehouse equipment and other\n","3 to 15 years\n","Computer, software and equipment\n","1 to 5 years\n","Lease Obligations\n","The Company has operating leases primarily for real estate, warehouse equipment, material handling equipment, trucks, trailers and containers and finance leases for equipment. The Company\n","determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company recognizes lease assets and liabilities at the lease commencement date based on the\n","present value of the lease payments over the lease term.\n","For most of the Company’s leases, the implicit rate cannot be readily determined and, as a result, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates at the commencement date to determine the\n","present value of future lease payments. For leases that include fixed rental payments for both the use of the asset (“lease costs”) as well as for other occupancy or service costs relating to the asset\n","(“non-lease costs”), the Company generally includes both the lease costs and non-lease costs as a single lease component in the measurement of the lease asset and liability. Certain lease agreements\n","include rental payments based on changes in the consumer price index (“CPI”). Lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the CPI; instead, changes in the CPI are treated as variable\n","lease payments and are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. These payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred.\n","Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Lease expense is\n","recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably certain. Amounts received from a landlord are included as a reduction to the\n","lease asset and are included within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n","Long-lived assets geographic information\n","The Company’s long-lived assets for this disclosure is defined as Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, and operating lease assets. The Company’s long-lived assets by geographic\n","region were as follows:\n","December 31,\n","(In millions)\n","2023\n","2022\n","United States\n","$\n","1,545 \n","$\n","1,532 \n","United Kingdom\n","772 \n","834 \n","Other\n","837 \n","821 \n","Total\n","$\n","3,154 \n","$\n","3,187 \n","Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n","The Company records goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting\n","unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. The Company has three reporting units: i) Americas and Asia-Pacific, ii) United Kingdom and Ireland and iii) Continental Europe. The\n","Company measures goodwill impairment, if any, as the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\n","40\n","The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on November 1. The review of goodwill impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely\n","than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a one-step quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers many\n","factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including declines in the Company’s stock price, market capitalization of the Company and macroeconomic\n","conditions. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional\n","quantitative impairment testing is performed. The quantitative test requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting\n","unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). The Company uses the income approach and/or a market-\n","based approach to determine the reporting units’ fair values. The determination of discounted cash flows used in the income approach requires significant estimates and assumptions. Due to the\n","inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n","The Company’s intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, and developed technology which are amortized on a straight-line basis or over the period the economic\n","benefits are expected to be realized. The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be\n","recoverable.\n","Impairment of Long-lived Assets\n","The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held-and-used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If an\n","impairment indicator is present, the Company evaluates recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the\n","remaining useful life of a long-lived asset group. If the assets are impaired, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the\n","asset. The Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate consistent with the risks associated with the recovery of the asset.\n","Segment Reporting\n","The Company is comprised of three operating segments based on the operating results regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), who is the Chief Executive Officer\n","(“CEO”), to make decisions about resource allocation and the performance of the business. These three operating segments have been aggregated into a single reporting segment.\n","Revenue Recognition\n","The Company generates revenue by providing logistics services for its customers, including warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, reverse logistics, packaging and labeling, factory and\n","aftermarket support and inventory management ranging from a few months to a few years. Generally, the Company’s contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more\n","services, including but not limited to facility and equipment costs, construction, repair and maintenance services and labor. For these contracts, the Company does not consider the services to be\n","distinct within the context of the contract when the separate scopes of work combine into a single commercial objective or capability for the customer. Accordingly, the Company generally identifies\n","one performance obligation in its contracts, which is a series of distinct services that remain substantially the same over time and possess the same pattern of transfer.\n","Revenue is recognized using the series guidance over the period in which services are provided under the terms of the Company’s contractual relationships with its customers. The transaction price is\n","based on the amount specified in the contract with the customer and contains fixed and variable consideration. In general, the fixed consideration in a contract represents reimbursement for\n","warehouse, technology and equipment costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The variable consideration is\n","comprised of cost reimbursement based on the costs incurred, per-unit pricing is determined based\n","41\n","on units provided and time and materials pricing is based on the hours of services provided. The variable consideration component is recognized over time based on the level of activity. Generally,\n","pricing can be adjusted based on contractual provisions related to achieving agreed-upon performance metrics, changes in volumes, services and market conditions. Revenue relating to these pricing\n","adjustments is estimated and included in the consideration if it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in the future. The estimate of variable consideration is determined by the\n","expected value or most likely amount method and factors in current, past and forecasted experience with the customer. Customers are billed based on terms specified in the revenue contract and they\n","pay us according to approved payment terms.\n","Contract Assets and Liabilities\n","Contract assets consist of two components: customer acquisition costs and costs to fulfill a contract. The Company capitalizes direct and incremental costs incurred to obtain and to fulfill a contract in\n","advance of revenue recognition, such as certain labor, third-party service and related product costs. These costs are recognized as an asset if the Company expects to recover them. Contract assets are\n","recognized consistent with the transfer of the underlying performance obligations to the customer based on the specific contracts to which they relate. Contract assets are primarily amortized to Direct\n","operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the contract term.\n","Contract liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration or the amount that is due from the customer.\n","Derivative Instruments\n","The Company records all its derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as a hedge, and effective as\n","part of a hedge transaction, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income or as a basis adjustment to the\n","underlying hedged item and reclassified to earnings in the year in which the hedged item affects earnings. The effective portion of the gain or loss on hedges of foreign net investments is generally\n","not reclassified to earnings unless the net investment is disposed. To the extent derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedges, or are ineffective, their changes in fair value are recorded in\n","earnings immediately, which may subject us to increased earnings volatility.\n","Stock-Based Compensation\n","The Company accounts for stock-based compensation based on the equity instrument’s grant date fair value. Stock compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line method, based on the\n","grant date fair value, over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. For grants of restricted stock units (“RSU”) subject to service-based or performance-based\n","vesting conditions only, the Company establishes the fair value based on the market price on the date of the grant. For grants of awards subject to market-based vesting conditions (“PSU”), the\n","Company determines the fair value based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n","Earnings per Share\n","Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted\n","earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive stock awards that were outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential\n","exercise of stock-based awards when the effect of the potential exercise would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the number of common shares excluded from\n","diluted shares outstanding was 1.5 million, 2.0 million and 0.1 million, respectively, because the effect of including those common shares in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.\n","42\n","On August 2, 2021, the date of the Separation, 114.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock were distributed to XPO stockholders. These 114.6 million shares have been utilized for the\n","calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods prior to the date of the Separation as no shares of common stock or equity-based awards of the Company were outstanding before that\n","date.\n","Defined Benefit Plans\n","The Company calculates its employer-sponsored retirement plan obligations using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Assumptions include discount rates, expected long-term rate of\n","return on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors. The assumptions used in recording the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets represent the Company’s best estimates based\n","on available information regarding historical experience and factors that may cause future expectations to differ. The Company’s obligation and future expense amounts could be materially impacted\n","by differences in experience or changes in assumptions.\n","The Company determines the net periodic benefit cost of the plans using assumptions regarding the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year. Net\n","periodic benefit cost is recorded within Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company calculates the funded status of the defined benefit plan as the difference between\n","the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets.\n","The impact of plan amendments, actuarial gains and losses and prior-service costs are recorded in AOCIL and are generally amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the remaining\n","service period of the active employees covered by the defined benefit pension plans. Cumulative gains and losses over 10% of the greater of the beginning of year benefit obligation or fair value of\n","the plan assets are amortized over the expected average life expectancy.\n","Income Taxes\n","The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis, under which the Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable\n","for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. The calculation\n","of the annual effective tax rate relies on several factors including pre-tax earnings, various jurisdiction statutory tax rates, tax credits, uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances and differences\n","between tax laws and accounting laws. The effective tax rate in any financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the blend and/or level of earnings by individual taxing\n","jurisdictions.\n","If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, presuming an examination by a taxing authority\n","with full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company recognizes all or a portion of the benefit. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that the Company’s\n","deferred tax assets will not be realized based on all available evidence.\n","The Company uses judgments and estimates in evaluating its tax positions. The Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by U.S. Federal, state and local and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The\n","Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years. The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax\n","positions only if based on the technical merits of the position it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit. The Company adjusts these tax liabilities, including related\n","interest and penalties, based on the current facts and circumstances. The Company reports tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\n","43\n","Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions\n","The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that use their local currency as their functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars (“USD”) using the exchange rate prevailing at\n","each balance sheet date, with balance sheet currency translation adjustments recorded in AOCIL in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company converts foreign currency transactions recognized\n","in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to USD by applying the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the\n","effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n","Adoption of New Accounting Standards\n","In 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\n","Reporting.” The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are\n","met. The ASU applies only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate\n","reform. In 2021, the FASB expanded the scope of the guidance to include derivatives. On March 9, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to its revolving credit facility replacing\n","LIBOR-based benchmark rates with SOFR-based benchmark rates and other conforming changes (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Company has transitioned its existing contracts to a\n","replacement index. ASU 2020-04 and its amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\n","In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\n","Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and\n","interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The\n","Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which provides for expanded disclosures primarily related to income taxes\n","paid and the rate reconciliation. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption and retrospective application are permitted.\n","The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","44\n","3.

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n","Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued\n","expenses and current maturities of long-term debt approximated their fair values as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, due to their short-term nature.\n","53\n","Debt\n","The fair value of debt was as follows:\n","December 31, 2023\n","December 31, 2022\n","(In millions)\n","Level\n","Fair Value\n","Carrying Value\n","Fair Value\n","Carrying Value\n","Unsecured notes due 2026\n","2\n","$\n","362 \n","$\n","398 \n","$\n","342 \n","$\n","397 \n","Unsecured notes due 2031\n","2\n","326 \n","397 \n","294 \n","397 \n","Two-Year Term Loan due 2024\n","2\n","— \n","— \n","115 \n","115 \n","Three-Year Term Loan due 2025\n","2\n","231 \n","235 \n","234 \n","234 \n","Five-Year Term Loan due 2027\n","2\n","493 \n","499 \n","499 \n","499 \n","Financial Instruments\n","The Company directly manages its exposure to risks arising from business operations and economic factors, including fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies. The Company uses\n","derivative instruments to manage the volatility related to these exposures. The objective of these derivative instruments is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in\n","foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company does not expect to incur any losses as a result of\n","counterparty default.\n","Net Investment Hedges\n","The Company uses fixed-to-fixed or variable-to-variable cross-currency swap agreements to hedge its net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the\n","U.S. dollar and the associated foreign currencies. The Company designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and accounts for them as net investment hedges.\n","In October 2023, the Company terminated a hedge with a notional amount of $115 million and amended a $235 million hedge to extend its maturity from 2024 to 2025.

The Company designated these interest rate swap agreements\n","as qualifying hedging instruments and accounts for them as cash flow hedges. When an interest rate swap agreement qualifies for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge, the changes in the fair value\n","are recorded in equity as a component of AOCIL and are reclassified into Interest expense, net over the life of the underlying debt, as interest on the Company’s floating rate debt is accrued. In\n","January 2024, the Company entered into an interest rate swap schedule to mature in 2025, with a notional amount of $125 million.\n","Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n","The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company uses foreign currency option contracts to mitigate\n","the risk of a reduction in the value of earnings from its operations that use the Euro or British pound sterling as their functional currency. Additionally, the Company uses foreign currency forward\n","contracts to mitigate exposure from variability of cash flows related to the forecasted interest and principal payments on intercompany loans. The foreign currency forward contracts generally expire\n","within 12 months. While these derivatives are hedging the fluctuations in foreign currencies, they do not meet the requirements to be accounted for as hedging instruments.\n","54\n","Derivatives\n","The notional amount and fair value of derivative instruments were as follows:\n","December 31,\n","2023\n","2022\n","(In millions)\n","Notional Amount\n","Fair Value\n","Notional Amount\n","Fair Value\n","Balance Sheet Location\n","Derivatives designated as hedges\n","Assets:\n","Interest rate swaps\n","$\n","125 \n","$\n","2 \n","$\n","— \n","$\n","— \n","Other current assets\n","Interest rate swaps\n","125 \n","3 \n","250 \n","9 \n","Other long-term assets\n","Cross-currency swap agreements\n","487 \n","3 \n","1,222 \n","22 \n","Other long-term assets\n","Liabilities:\n","Cross-currency swap agreements\n","$\n","165 \n","$\n","7 \n","$\n","115 \n","$\n","13 \n","Other current liabilities\n","Cross-currency swap agreements\n","883 \n","49 \n","— \n","— \n","Other long-term liabilities\n","Derivatives not designated as hedges\n","Assets:\n","Foreign currency option contracts\n","$\n","397 \n","$\n","8 \n","$\n","— \n","$\n","— \n","Other current assets\n","Foreign currency forward contracts\n","1 \n","— \n","— \n","— \n","Other current assets\n","Liabilities:\n","Foreign currency option contracts\n","$\n","— \n","$\n","— \n","$\n","354 \n","$\n","5 \n","Other current liabilities\n","Foreign currency forward contracts\n","— \n","— \n","3 \n","— \n","Other current liabilities\n","As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the derivatives were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

However, any unused holiday entitlement carried forward in this way will lapse if it remains untaken 15 months after the end of the holiday year in which it is accrued. For the avoidance of doubt, any paid holiday actually taken in any leave year will be deemed to have been the Executive’s four week statutory holiday entitlement. 13.5 The Executive’s entitlement to paid holiday in the holiday year in which their employment terminates or commences will be pro rata for each completed calendar month of service in that year. The Board may require the Executive to take any accrued but untaken holiday entitlement during their notice period.

Re-imbursement of excess holiday taken by the Executive shall be recoverable from the Executive in full at the rate at which it was paid to them. 13.8 Details of any additional paid leave\n","provided by the Company (other than to sickness leave under Clause 14) and the terms under which this operates is available from Human Resources Department.\n"," \n","14 23 March 2021 014-5340-3872/4/EUROPE 14.

If the incapacity continues for a period of seven days or more they will produce to the Company a medical certificate to cover the duration of such absence. 14.2 Subject to the rest of this Clause 14 and subject to the receipt of the appropriate certificates in accordance with Clause 14.1, if the Executive is absent from their duties as a result of illness or injury they will be entitled to be paid at the rate and for the period specified in The Schedule in any period of 12 months (whether the absence is intermittent or continuous) subject to deduction of any statutory sick pay received by the Executive.

Restatements. In the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company will recover reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by the Covered Executive. If the Committee cannot determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the accounting restatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement. Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation will apply to any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received on or after October 2, 2023 by a Covered Executive: After beginning service as a Covered Executive; Who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation; While the Company has a class of securities listed on the Exchange; and During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company was required to prepare the Restatement (including any transition period within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year, determined in accordance with the rules of the Exchange). However, a transition period between the last day of the Company’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year. The Company’s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. For purposes of determining the relevant recovery period, the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement is the earlier to occur of: the date on which the Board, a\n","committee thereof or the Company’s officer(s) authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement; and the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may, in its discretion, seek recoupment of any excess Incentive Compensation from a Covered Executive from any of the following sources: (1) prior Incentive Compensation payments; (2) future payments of Incentive Compensation; (3) cancellation of outstanding Incentive Compensation; and (4) direct repayment. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may offset such amount against any compensation or other amounts owed by the Company to the Covered Executive.

Administration This Policy shall be administered by the Committee. Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals, and need not be uniform with respect to Covered Executives. The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. This policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 thereunder, and the applicable rules of the Exchange, and will be interpreted and administered consistent with that intent. Amendment; Termination The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act, or any rules or standards adopted by the Exchange. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Other Recoupment Rights Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any Compensation Agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal or equitable remedies available to the Company.

Limited Exceptions to Recovery Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its discretion, may choose to forgo recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the following circumstances, on the condition that the Committee (or a majority of the independent members of the Board) has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable because: the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this policy would exceed the recoverable amounts, and in which case the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, has documented that attempt and has (to the extent required) provided that documentation to the Exchange; or\n"," \n","-6- 71533835;8 recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax‐qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation, and shall provide such opinion to the Exchange. No Indemnification; No Liability The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, nor shall the Company directly or indirectly pay or reimburse any Covered Executive for any premiums for third-party insurance policies that such Covered Executive may elect to purchase to fund such Covered Executive’s potential obligations under this Policy. None of the Company, an affiliate of the Company or any member of the Committee or the Board shall have any liability to any Covered Executive as a result of actions taken under this Policy.

All statements other than statements of\n","historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “anticipate,”\n","“estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,”\n","“effort,” “target,” “trajectory” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These\n","forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected\n","future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and\n","assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed\n","or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to a material difference include those discussed below and the risks discussed in the Company’s other filings\n","with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance\n","that the results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its\n","business or operations.\n","The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and corresponding notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n","Forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report speak only as of the date hereof, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events\n","or circumstances, changes in expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\n","Part I\n","Item 1. Business.\n","Company Overview\n","GXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“GXO,” the “Company,” “our” or “we”), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world and a foremost innovator in an industry\n","propelled by strong secular tailwinds. We provide our customers with high-value-added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services\n","differentiated by our ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at scale. As of December 31, 2023, our 131,000 team members operated in 974 facilities worldwide totaling 199\n","million square feet of space, primarily on behalf of large corporations that have outsourced their warehousing, distribution and other related activities to us.\n","Our revenue is diversified among over one thousand customers, including many multinational corporations, across numerous verticals. Our customers rely on us to move their goods, with high\n","efficiency, through their supply chains — from the moment goods arrive at our warehouses through fulfillment and distribution, and the management of returned products. Our customer base includes\n","many blue-chip leaders in sectors that demonstrate high growth and/or durable demand, with significant growth potential through customer outsourcing of logistics services.\n","GXO became a standalone publicly traded company on August 2, 2021, when GXO completed its separation (the “Separation”) from XPO, Inc. (“XPO”) and began regular-way trading on the New\n","York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GXO.” GXO was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2021.\n","Our Strategy\n","We design and operate the most advanced warehouse solutions in the world. Our strategy is to help our customers manage their warehouse needs for optimal efficiency, using our network of people,\n","technology and other physical assets. We deliver value to customers in the form of technological innovations, process efficiencies, cost efficiencies and reliable outcomes. Our services are highly\n","responsive to customer goals, such as increasing visibility in the supply chain, decreasing fulfillment times and mitigating environmental impacts, while being proactive in identifying potential\n","improvements.\n","GXO creates short- and long-term value for customers and shareholders through our unique combination of technology, scale and expertise. Our strategy addresses growth and optimization by\n","focusing on core verticals that demonstrate enduring demand over time and where we already have a deep presence. We expect to attract new customers and expand the services we provide to\n","existing customers through new projects, thus earning more of their logistics spend. We integrate best practices to drive productivity, with a focus on automation and other levers of profitable growth.\n","To aid in executing our strategy, we have instilled a culture that focuses on delivering mutually beneficial results for our customers and our company with the highest legal and ethical standards and\n","clear policies and practices to support compliance throughout our organization.\n","Technology and Intellectual Property\n","Contract logistics is becoming more and more complex, as changing consumer expectations and preferences continue to drive a need for faster delivery times, higher levels of returned inventory and\n","better visibility throughout the supply chain. Traditional warehousing solutions are no longer sufficient to fill these needs. The industry needs scaled technology players, like GXO, to deliver these\n","complex solutions.\n","Technology is a core competitive advantage for GXO and fundamental to how we win and retain business. GXO was an early adopter of technology, and more than 30% of our warehouses are\n","technology-enabled compared to the industry average of approximately 10%. Technology enables us to add value to our customers’ end-to-end\n","1\n","operations in terms of cost, efficiency, accuracy and environmental impact. Investments in cutting-edge technology are a major growth driver for our business.\n","Our highly scalable warehouse management platform is built on the cloud to speed the deployment of new ways to increase efficiency and leverage our footprint. In a relatively short time, we can\n","implement innovations across multiple geographies or take an innovation developed for one vertical and apply it to other verticals to enhance the value we offer our customers.\n","To date, the most significant impacts of our proprietary technology are in three areas: labor and inventory management productivity, intelligent warehouse automation and predictive analytics, all of\n","which are integrated through our proprietary warehouse management platform.\n","Labor and Inventory Management\n","Our productivity is driven by our comprehensive suite of intelligent tools and analytics designed to optimize labor and inventory management. This technology incorporates dynamic data science,\n","predictive analytics and machine learning to aid decision-making. Our site managers use these tools to improve productivity in site-specific ways in a safe, disciplined and cost-effective manner.\n","Intelligent Warehouse Automation\n","Our intelligent warehouse automation includes deployments of autonomous robots and collaborative robots (“cobots”), automated sortation systems, automated guided vehicles, goods-to-person\n","systems and wearable devices — these are all effective ways to deliver critical improvements in speed, accuracy and productivity. Importantly, automation also enhances safety and the overall quality\n","of employment. Our warehouse management system creates a synchronized environment across automation platforms to control these technologies holistically, providing an integrated solution.\n","We have found that autonomous goods-to-person systems and cobots, which assist workers with the inventory picking process, can improve labor productivity. Stationary robot arms can repeat\n","demanding tasks with greater precision than is possible manually. Robots are particularly valuable in markets with labor shortages and where wage inflation can erode customer margins.\n","Other technologies that differentiate our logistics environments are our proprietary warehouse module for order management, which gives customers deep visibility into fulfillment flows, and our\n","analytics dashboard, which gives customers valuable business intelligence to manage their supply chains. Our connection management software module facilitates integration with SAP, Oracle and\n","other external systems, enabling our customers to get the maximum benefit from our technology.\n","Predictive Analytics\n","Our predictive analytics add significant value for customers, particularly in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, where seasonality drives high volumes through outbound and inbound logistics\n","processes. For example, up to 30% of consumer goods bought online are returned, and this creates increased volumes at certain times of the year. We have developed analytics that predict surges in\n","demand using a combination of historical data and customer forecasting.\n","As an industry leader that invests substantially in technology, we have access to an immense amount of data, as well as the analytical processing capabilities to capitalize on that data by incorporating\n","our learnings into customer solutions. We believe our ability to process and act upon data is a key competitive advantage and differentiator.\n","2\n","Customers and Markets\n","We provide our customers with high-value-added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services. We provide services to customers\n","globally, including Fortune 100 companies in the U.S., Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, European multinational market leaders and other renowned global brands. The customers we\n","serve are primarily in North America and Europe and operate in every major industry. The diversification of our customer base reduces concentration risk. In 2023, our top five customers combined\n","accounted for approximately 17% of our total revenue, and no customer represented more than 4%.\n","Our revenue is highly diversified due to our expertise across multiple verticals, reflecting our customers’ principal industry sectors. In 2023, 42% of our revenue was from Omnichannel retail, 15%\n","from Technology and consumer electronics, 14% from Food and beverage, 11% from Industrial and manufacturing, 11% from Consumer packaged goods, and 7% from other industries, with the vast\n","majority of our revenue generated in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Italy.\n","Seasonality\n","During the fourth quarter, our business benefits from strong positioning in the e-commerce sector, where demand is characterized by surges in activity associated with the holiday season. Our revenue\n","and profitability are typically lower in the first quarter of the calendar year relative to other quarters. This is due in part to seasonality, namely the post-holiday reduction in demand experienced by\n","many of our customers, which leads to less use of the logistics services we provide.\n","Competition\n","We operate in a highly competitive global industry with a highly fragmented marketplace where thousands of companies compete domestically and internationally. We compete based on our ability to\n","deliver quality service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities, expertise and pricing.\n","Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies that offer services similar to those we provide. Our competitors include CEVA, DHL, DSV, GEODIS, ID Logistics,\n","Kuehne + Nagel and Ryder. Due to the competitive nature of our marketplace, we strive daily to strengthen and expand existing business relationships and forge new relationships.\n","Government Regulations\n","Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the U.S. at the local, state, and federal levels and in other countries where we conduct business. These regulations\n","impact us directly and indirectly when they regulate third parties with which we arrange or contract services. In addition, we are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations,\n","including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes.\n","Environmental Sustainability\n","Environmental sustainability is a key pillar of our Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) strategy. We are partnering with customers around the globe to help them achieve their\n","environmental goals while we innovate to reduce our impact. For many of our customers, the logistics component of their supply chain accounts for a sizeable portion of their greenhouse gas\n","(“GHG”) emissions and waste footprint. We collaborate with customers to create action plans that reduce emissions related to their supply chains through technology-enabled solutions.\n","Our environmental sustainability strategy is designed to be applicable globally while also compliant with local environmental regulations. Throughout our business, GXO has identified GHG\n","emissions and waste associated with operations as our greatest opportunities to reduce our environmental impact. In 2021, we established environmental\n","3\n","targets to track and prioritize our reduction of Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions and increase waste diversion rates globally. Part of our environmental strategy focuses on improving the energy\n","efficiency of our buildings. We have a global initiative to replace our warehouse lighting with LED and are developing our strategy to increase the amount of renewable electricity used in our\n","buildings.\n","In 2023, we began an exercise to quantify our full carbon footprint, including our Scope 3 emissions. We anticipate the results of this exercise in the first half of 2024.\n","Human Capital\n","Our success relies in large part on our robust governance structure and Code of Business Ethics, our corporate citizenship and engaged employees who embrace our values. As a customer-centric\n","company with a strong service culture, we constantly work to maintain and improve our position as an employer of choice. This requires an unwavering commitment to workplace inclusion and\n","safety as well as competitive total compensation that meets the needs of our employees and their families.\n","Employee Profile\n","As of December 31, 2023, we operated in 27 countries with approximately 131,000 team members (comprising approximately 87,000 full-time and part-time employees and 44,000 temporary\n","workers engaged through third-party agencies). Our workforce is located: 47% in the United Kingdom, 25% in Europe (excluding the United Kingdom), 25% in North America and 3% in Latin\n","America and Asia combined. The majority of our employees in Europe and the United Kingdom were covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our employees in North America\n","were covered by collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 36% of our global workforce were women, and 66% of our workforce in the U.S. were ethnic minorities.\n","We have made and continue to make significant investments in the safety, well-being and satisfaction of our employees in numerous areas, including diversity, inclusion and belonging; health and\n","safety; talent development and engagement; and expansive total rewards.\n","Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging\n","We take pride in having an inclusive workplace that encourages a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives and mandates fair treatment for all individuals. These attributes of our culture make us a\n","stronger organization and a better partner to all GXO stakeholders. We welcome employees of every gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, life experience,\n","veteran status and disability.\n","Health and Safety\n","Our employees’ safety is always our foremost priority, and we have numerous protocols in place to ensure a safe workplace environment. We aim to maintain an Occupational Safety and Health\n","Administration recordable incident rate that is less than half the published rate for the General Warehousing and Storage sector, based on the “Industry Injury and Illness Data” of the U.S. Bureau of\n","Labor Statistics.\n","Talent Development and Engagement\n","Our employees are critically important to our ability to provide best-in-class service. We ask our employees for feedback through engagement surveys, roundtables and town halls. We use periodic\n","engagement surveys to gauge our progress and assess satisfaction. In this way, our employees help drive the continuous improvement of our business. We seek to identify top talent in all aspects of\n","the recruitment process and we emphasize training and development supported by our own online GXO University.\n","We tailor our recruitment efforts by geography and job function, using an array of channels to ensure a diverse candidate pool. Our talent development infrastructure provides resources to employees\n","who aspire to grow\n","4\n","throughout their careers, such as tailored skills development, training and mentoring. In addition, we maintain a robust pipeline of future operations leaders by using structured sponsorships and\n","additional learning techniques to develop internal candidates who demonstrate high potential to advance from supervisory roles into site leader positions. Our programs also retain top talent by\n","defining personalized development paths and attract new talent by differentiating GXO as an employer of choice.\n","Expansive Total Rewards\n","We offer a competitive compensation package to help attract and retain outstanding talent. We offer competitive wages and a comprehensive suite of benefits to all employees to maintain our position\n","as an employer of choice in the talent marketplace. A number of the benefits we offer were introduced in response to employee feedback — in the U.S., examples include our pregnancy care policy,\n","family bonding policy, tuition reimbursement program for continuing education, and benefits such as diabetes management, supplemental insurance and short-term loans. In Europe, the benefits\n","offered vary by country and are tailored to the needs of the local markets. Examples include comprehensive healthcare and risk insurance, employee assistance programs covering mental, physical\n","and financial well-being, pension plans, profit sharing and local and global bonuses structured to offer competitive pay in each country.\n","Information About Our Executive Officers\n","The following information relates to our current executive officers:\n","Name\n","Age\n","Position\n","Malcolm Wilson\n","65\n","Chief Executive Officer\n","Baris Oran\n","50\n","Chief Financial Officer\n","Karlis Kirsis\n","44\n","Chief Legal Officer\n","Elizabeth Fogarty\n","54\n","Chief Communications Officer\n","Richard Cawston\n","50\n","Chief Revenue Officer\n","Malcolm Wilson has served as Chief Executive Officer since the Separation in August 2021, after serving as Chief Executive Officer of XPO Logistics Europe since September 2017.

Reports filed with the SEC can be viewed at http://www.sec.gov and on our\n","corporate website at www.gxo.com. Materials are available online as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically submit them to the SEC. Further materials regarding our corporate\n","governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Ethics and the charters relating to the committees of our Board of Directors, are also available\n","on the investors section of our website.\n","Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n","The following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations,\n","including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report or our other filings with the SEC or in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to\n","the public. You should carefully consider the following factors in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and our\n","Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8.\n","Risks Related to Our Business\n","Risks Related to Our Strategy and Operations\n","We operate in a highly competitive industry, and failure to compete or respond to customer requirements could negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\n","The logistics industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. We compete against multinational firms, regional players and emerging technology companies.\n","We also must contend with our customers’ ability to in-source their logistics operations. The competitive factors that are most important to our customers are price and quality of service. Many larger\n","customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers. Customers regularly solicit bids from competitors to improve service and to secure favorable pricing and contractual terms such as longer\n","payment terms, fixed-price arrangements, higher or unlimited liability and performance penalties. Increased competition and competitors’ acceptance of more onerous contractual terms could result in\n","reduced revenues, reduced margins, higher operating costs or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","Increases in our labor costs to attract, develop and retain employees may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n","Our workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. To grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a\n","large number of hourly employees while controlling labor costs. Many of our long-term customer contracts are fixed-price arrangements that limit our ability to pass on to our customers increases in\n","labor costs due to low unemployment, increases in government unemployment benefits, competitive pressures, union activity or changes in federal or state minimum wage or overtime laws and any\n","such increases in labor costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","Additionally, our operations are subject to various employment-related laws and regulations, which govern matters such as minimum wages, union organizing rights, the classification of employees\n","and independent contractors, family and medical leave, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions and a variety of similar laws that govern these and other\n","employment-related matters. Any changes to employment-related laws and regulations, including increased minimum wages or the expansion of union organization rights, could result in increased\n","labor costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","6\n","Labor represents a significant portion of our operating expenses, thus, compliance with these evolving laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business, while failure to do\n","so could subject us to significant fines and lawsuits and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are currently subject to employment-related\n","claims in connection with our operations. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings are in various stages of adjudication or investigation and involve a wide variety of claims and potential outcomes.\n","We depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and temporary workers.\n","We depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, including our executive officers and managers. If we are unable to attract and retain such individuals, we may be unable to maintain\n","our current competitive position within the industry, meet our customers’ expectations or successfully expand and grow our business.\n","Our ability to meet customer demands and expectations, especially during periods of peak volume, is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit and retain qualified temporary part-time and full-\n","time workers. Increased demand for temporary workers, low unemployment or changes in federal or state minimum wage laws may increase the costs of temporary labor, and any such increases in\n","labor costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting actions, as well as other macro-economic\n","headwinds such as inflation and supply change disruptions increased the potential for labor shortages and heightened levels of employee turnover. Therefore, our inability to recruit a qualified\n","temporary workforce may result in our inability to meet our customers’ performance targets.\n","Our past acquisitions, as well as any acquisitions that we may complete in the future, may be unsuccessful or result in other risks or developments that adversely affect our financial condition\n","and results.\n","While we intend for our acquisitions to improve our competitiveness and profitability, we cannot be certain that our past or future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings or otherwise meet our\n","operational or strategic expectations. Special risks, including accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology or human resources issues may arise in connection with, or as a result of, the\n","acquisition of an existing company, including the assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, possible management distractions or the\n","inability of the acquired business to achieve the levels of revenue, income, productivity or synergies we anticipate or otherwise perform as we expect on the timeline contemplated. We are unable to\n","predict all the risks that could arise as a result of our acquisitions.\n","If the performance of an acquired business varies from our projections or assumptions or if estimates about the future profitability of an acquired business change, our revenues, earnings or other\n","aspects of our financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also experience difficulties in connection with integrating any acquired companies into our existing businesses and operations,\n","including our existing infrastructure and information technology systems. The infrastructure and information technology systems of acquired companies could present issues that we were unable to\n","identify prior to the acquisition and could adversely affect our financial condition and results. We have experienced challenges of this nature relating to the infrastructure and systems of certain\n","companies that we have acquired. Also, we may not realize all of the synergies we anticipate from past and potential future acquisitions. Among the synergies that we currently expect to realize are\n","cross-selling opportunities to our existing customers, as well as network and operational efficiencies. Variances from these or other assumptions or expectations could adversely affect our financial\n","condition and results of operations.\n","We may not successfully manage our growth.\n","We have grown rapidly and substantially over prior years, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions and entering new markets and we intend to continue to focus on rapid\n","growth, including organic growth and additional acquisitions. We may experience difficulties and higher than expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new\n","markets, changes in revenue and business models, entry into new geographic areas or increased pressure on our existing infrastructure and information technology systems.\n","7\n","Our growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational, financial and information technology resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls, as\n","well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems and procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will continue\n","to increase as our operations grow. Failure to manage our growth effectively or obtain necessary working capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows\n","and financial condition.\n","Our overseas operations are subject to various operational and financial risks that could adversely affect our business.\n","The services we provide outside the U.S. are subject to risks resulting from changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, tax rules and policies, difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign\n","operations and agents, different liability standards, issues related to compliance with anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, data protection, trade\n","compliance and intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights relating to our intellectual property, including our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as U.S. laws.\n","The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region. In addition, as we expand\n","our business in foreign countries, we will be exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls.\n","We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because a significant proportion of our assets, liabilities and earnings are denominated in foreign currencies.\n","We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars (“USD”), but we hold a significant proportion of our net assets and generate income in non-USD currencies, primarily the Euro and British pound\n","sterling. Consequently, a depreciation of non-USD currencies relative to the USD could have an adverse impact on our financial results as further discussed in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative\n","Disclosures about Market Risk.”\n","National and regional differences in monetary policy may cause the value of the non-USD currencies to fluctuate against the USD. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our revenue and\n","expenses in foreign currency jurisdictions. Accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n","Our inability to successfully manage the costs and operational difficulties of adding new customers and business may negatively affect our financial condition and operations.\n","Establishing new customer relationships or adding operational sites for existing customers requires a significant amount of time, operational focus and capital. Although we typically partner with our\n","new customers to ensure that onboarding is smooth, our inability to integrate new customers or operational sites into our technology systems or recruit additional employees to manage new customer\n","relationships or the incurrence of higher than anticipated costs to onboard new customers may negatively affect our financial condition or operations.\n","In addition, our operations can require a significant commitment of capital in the form of shelving, racking and other warehousing systems that may be necessary to implement warehouse solutions\n","for our customers. These costs are often billed to the customer over the expected length of the customer relationship. To the extent that a customer defaults on its obligations under its agreement with\n","us, we could be forced to take a significant loss on the unrecovered portion of the upfront capital costs.\n","The contractual terms between us and our customers could expose us to penalties and other costs in the event we do not meet the contractually prescribed performance levels.\n","We maintain long-term contracts with the majority of our customers, many of which include performance-based minimum levels of service. Although we manage our business to exceed prescribed\n","performance levels, our inability to meet these service levels, whether due to labor shortages, volume peaks, our inability to procure temporary labor,\n","8\n","technological malfunctions or other events that may or may not be within our control, may expose us to penalties or incremental costs or lead to the termination of customer contracts, any of which\n","could negatively affect our business and financial condition.\n","Our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, and our inability to manage these fluctuations could negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\n","Many of our customers typically realize a significant portion of their sales during the holiday season in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Although not all of our customers experience the same\n","seasonal variation, and some customers may have seasonal peaks that occur in periods other than the fourth quarter, the seasonality of our customers’ businesses places higher demands on our\n","services during peak periods, requiring us to take measures, including temporarily expanding our workforce, to meet our customers’ demands. Our failure to meet our customers’ expectations during\n","these seasonal peaks may negatively affect our customer relationships, could expose us to penalties under our contractual arrangements with customers and ultimately could negatively affect our\n","business and our results of operations.\n","Damage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity or the actions of our employees or temporary workers could adversely affect our financial condition.\n","Our success depends on our ability to consistently deliver operational excellence and strong customer service. Our inability to deliver our services and solutions as promised on a consistent basis, or\n","our customers having a negative experience or otherwise becoming dissatisfied, can negatively impact our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation,\n","which could, in turn, adversely affect revenue and earnings growth. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees, contractors, agents or others with whom we do\n","business, such as customer service issues, could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter),\n","Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. This unfavorable publicity could also\n","require us to allocate significant resources to rebuild our reputation.\n","We face risks associated with the handling of customer inventory.\n","Under some of our agreements, we maintain the inventory of our customers, some of which may be significant in value. Our failure to properly handle and safeguard such inventory exposes us to\n","potential claims and expenses as well as harm to our business and reputation.\n","Risks Related to Our Use of Technology\n","Our business will be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate our information technology systems, including the systems of any\n","businesses that we acquire.\n","We rely heavily on our information technology systems in managing our business; they are a key component of our customer-facing services and internal growth strategy. In general, we expect our\n","customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated technology. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly address market trends and\n","enhance the features and functionality of our proprietary technology platform in response to these trends. This process of continuous enhancement may lead to significant ongoing software\n","development costs, which will continue to increase if we pursue new acquisitions of companies and their current systems. In addition, we may fail to accurately determine the needs of our customers\n","or trends in the logistics industry, or we may fail to respond appropriately by implementing functionality for our technology platform in a timely or cost-effective manner. Any such failures could\n","result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues.\n","If our information technology systems are unable to manage high volumes with reliability, accuracy and speed as we grow, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various services we offer,\n","our service levels and operating\n","9\n","efficiency could decline. In addition, if we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect and maintain our information technology systems, or if we fail to enhance our systems to\n","meet our customers’ needs, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n","Our technology may not be successful or may not achieve the desired results, and we may require additional training or different personnel to successfully implement this technology. Our technology\n","development process may be subject to cost overruns or delays in obtaining the expected results, which may result in disruptions to our operations. Technology and new market entrants may also\n","disrupt the way we and our competitors operate.\n","If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, if our technology does not provide the anticipated benefits or it does not meet market demands, we may be placed at a competitive\n","disadvantage and could lose customers, materially adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\n","A failure of our information technology infrastructure or a breach of our information systems, networks or processes may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n","The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, including internet and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business. We also rely on\n","third parties and virtualized infrastructure to operate our information technology systems. Despite significant testing for risk management, external and internal risks, such as malware, insecure\n","coding, “Acts of God,” data leakage and human error pose a direct threat to the stability or effectiveness of our information technology systems and operations. The failure of our information\n","technology systems to perform as we anticipate could adversely affect our business through transaction errors, billing and invoicing errors, internal recordkeeping and reporting errors, processing\n","inefficiencies and loss of sales, receivables collection or customers. Any such failure could result in harm to our reputation and have an ongoing adverse impact on our business, results of operations\n","and financial condition, including after the underlying failures have been remedied.\n","We may also be subject to cyberattacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyberattack could result in service interruptions,\n","operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liabilities to our customers or others, the diversion of corporate resources, injury to our reputation or increased service and maintenance costs.\n","Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to the resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. In addition, recently, regulatory and\n","enforcement focus on data protection has heightened in the U.S. and abroad, particularly in the European Union (“EU”), and failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection\n","regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could harm our business, its reputation, results of operations and financial\n","condition.\n","Issues related to the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, whether related to our failure to enforce our own rights or infringement claims brought by others, could have a\n","material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n","We use both internally developed and purchased technologies in conducting our business. It is possible that users of these technologies, whether internally developed or purchased, could be claimed\n","to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against us by a third party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, a settlement or\n","adverse judgment against us could result in increased costs to license the technology or a legal prohibition against continued use of the technology. Thus, our failure to obtain, maintain or enforce our\n","intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n","We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to protect\n","our intellectual property and technology. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated; our trade secrets and\n","other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third parties; or we may fail to secure the rights to intellectual property developed by\n","10\n","our employees, contractors and others. Efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be time-consuming and costly, distract management’s attention, divert our resources in other ways and\n","ultimately be unsuccessful. Moreover, should we fail to develop and properly manage future intellectual property, this could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities.\n","Risks Related to Our Credit and Liquidity\n","Challenges in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect our future access to capital on favorable terms.\n","Volatility in the world financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. Our ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on\n","acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our services or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or if there are other significantly unfavorable\n","changes in economic conditions.\n","We have incurred debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations.\n","Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could materially and adversely affect our\n","financial position and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with the covenants under our indebtedness may have a material adverse impact on our operations. If we fail to comply with any\n","of the covenants under our debt obligations and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, such failure may result in an event of default under our indebtedness. We may not have sufficient\n","liquidity to repay or refinance our indebtedness if such indebtedness were accelerated upon an event of default. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future.\n","Risks Related to Third-Party Relationships\n","Our business may be materially adversely affected by labor disputes or organizing efforts.\n","Labor disputes involving our customers could affect our operations. If our customers experience plant slowdowns or closures because they are unable to negotiate labor contracts, our revenue and\n","profitability could be negatively impacted. In particular, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the operation and management of facilities that are often located close to a customer’s\n","manufacturing plant and are integrated into the customer’s production line process. If any of our customers are affected by labor disputes and consequently cease or significantly modify their\n","operations at a plant served by us, we may experience significant revenue loss and shutdown costs, including costs related to early termination of leases.\n","In Europe, our business activities rely on a large amount of labor, including a number of workers who are affiliated with trade unions and other staff representative institutions. A deteriorating\n","economic environment may result in tensions in industrial relations, which may lead to industrial action within our European operations which could have a direct impact on our business operations.\n","Generally, any deterioration in industrial relations in our European operations, such as general strike activities or other material labor disputes, could have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings\n","and financial position.\n","Although our workforce in the U.S. is not unionized, labor unions have, from time to time, attempted to organize our employees. Successful unionization of our employees or organizing efforts could\n","lead to business interruptions, work stoppages and the reduction of service levels due to work rules and could have an adverse effect on our customer relationships and our revenues, earnings and\n","financial position.\n","11\n","Any failure to properly manage our temporary workers could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, earnings and financial position.\n","Our business uses a large number of temporary workers in our operations. We cannot guarantee that temporary workers are as well-trained as our other employees. Specifically, we may be exposed to\n","the risk that temporary workers may not perform their assignments in a satisfactory manner or may not comply with our safety rules in an appropriate manner, whether as a result of their lack of\n","experience or otherwise. If such risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n","Risks Related to Litigation and Regulations\n","We may be involved in lawsuits and are subject to various claims that could result in significant expenditures and impact our operations.\n","The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various types of claims and litigation. We are subject to claims and litigation related to our customer contracts and relationships, labor and\n","employment, personal injury, vehicular accidents, cargo and other property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters, including claims asserted under various other\n","theories of agency or employer liability. Claims against us may exceed the amount of insurance coverage that we have or may not be covered by insurance at all. Businesses that we acquire also\n","increase our exposure to litigation. Material increases in liability claims or workers’ compensation claims, the unfavorable resolution of claims or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under\n","indemnity provisions could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims\n","could affect our earnings.\n","We are subject to risks associated with a defined benefit plan for our current and former employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial position.\n","We maintain a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. A decline in interest rates or lower returns on funded plan assets may cause increases in the expense and funding requirements for this plan.\n","Despite past amendments that froze our defined benefit pension plan to new participants and curtailed benefits, this pension plan remains subject to volatility associated with interest rates, inflation,\n","returns on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions and statutory funding requirements. Any of these factors could lead to a significant increase in the expense of this plan and a deterioration in the\n","solvency of the plan, which could significantly increase our contribution requirements. As a result, we are unable to predict the effect on our financial statements associated with our defined benefit\n","pension plan.\n","Changes in tax laws and regulations for U.S. and multinational companies may increase our tax liability.\n","The U.S. Congress, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), the EU and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates do business have\n","maintained a focus on the taxation of multinational companies. During 2023, the OECD issued administrative guidance for the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion rules (“Pillar Two”), which\n","generally imposes a 15% global minimum tax on multinational companies. Many Pillar Two rules are effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2024, with other aspects to be effective from\n","2025. The Company regularly monitors developments in its jurisdictions and considers the impact of the tax-related proposals as they arise.\n","We are subject to regulations, which could negatively impact our business.\n","Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies at the local, state and federal levels in the U.S. and in the foreign countries where we operate. These regulatory agencies\n","have authority and oversight of domestic and international activities. Our subsidiaries must also comply with applicable regulations and requirements of various agencies.\n","12\n","The regulatory landscape in which we operate is constantly evolving and subject to significant change, including as a result of evolving political and social pressures. Future laws, regulations and\n","regulatory reforms may be more stringent and may require changes to our operating practices that influence the demand for our services or require us to incur significant additional costs. We are\n","unable to predict the impact that recently enacted and future regulations may have on our business. If higher costs are incurred by us as a result of future changes in regulations, this could adversely\n","affect our results of operations to the extent we are unable to obtain a corresponding increase in price from our customers.\n","Proposed or pending legislative or regulatory changes, or future legislative or regulatory changes, at the federal, state or local level may decrease demand for our services, increase our costs,\n","including our labor costs, and negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\n","Our business is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, including but not limited to changes that would encourage workers to unionize, make it easier for\n","workers to collectively bargain, increase operational requirements on our business or mandate certain restrictions on the terms of employment for individual workers, including how often they can\n","work or how long they can work in any individual shift. Any and all of these changes or other similar changes could have significant implications for our business model, including increasing our\n","labor costs, reducing our operational flexibility and restricting our ability to meet our customers’ expectations and demands, any of which could negatively affect our business and our results of\n","operations. If such regulations are adopted, they could increase our cost of operations or hinder our ability to meet our customers’ expectations and demands, either of which would negatively affect\n","our business and our results of operations.\n","Additionally, significant regulatory changes at the federal, state or local level may negatively affect economic output, cause growth to slow, reduce consumer spending and sentiment and result in\n","decreased demand for our services, negatively affecting our business and our results of operations.\n","Economic recessions and other factors, such as heightened geopolitical tensions or conflict, that reduce consumer spending, both in North America and Europe, could have a material adverse\n","impact on our business.\n","Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers’ business cycles and changes in customers’ business practices. Our customers experience cyclical fluctuations\n","in demand for their products due to economic recessions, which reduces the demand for our services and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","The ramifications of any period of heightened geopolitical tensions or conflicts, including increased international trade sanctions, may negatively impact regional and global economic markets,\n","including where we operate, may cause supply chain disruptions and may increase costs for labor, transportation and energy. Any period of heightened geopolitical tensions or conflict can increase\n","financial market volatility and could negatively affect our ability to raise additional capital when required. While we do not conduct business in Russia, the conflict and its effects could adversely\n","affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n","Risks Related to Environmental, Social and Governance\n","Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\n","Our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing discharges of\n","pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. The operation of our businesses entails risks under\n","environmental laws and regulations. For example, certain jurisdictions including the State of California enacted legislation requiring certain companies to disclose GHG emissions and climate-related\n","financial risk information. We could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations\n","of or liabilities under these laws and regulations. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to\n","13\n","comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\n","Our ability to achieve our ESG goals is subject to risks, many of which are outside our control, and our reputation could be harmed if we fail to meet such goals.\n","Our ability to achieve our ESG goals, including our goal to achieve 30% reduction in Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2030, and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents\n","numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks and may be dependent on the actions of suppliers and other third parties, all of which are outside our control. If we are unable to meet our ESG\n","goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, our reputation could be negatively impacted. If, as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices, certain investors are unsatisfied\n","with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company. If the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have\n","to undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics. Any failure or perceived failure to satisfy various ESG reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could\n","increase the risk of litigation.\n","Risks Related to the Separation\n","If the Separation, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax\n","liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify XPO for material amounts of taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax\n","Matters Agreement by and between XPO and GXO (the “TMA”).\n","In connection with the Separation, XPO received an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the Separation under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code\n","(the “Code”). The opinion of counsel was based upon and relies on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of XPO.\n","Notwithstanding the receipt of the opinion of counsel, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that the Separation and/or certain related transactions should be treated as\n","taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have\n","been violated.\n","If the Separation, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D)\n","of the Code, XPO would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the GXO common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and XPO stockholders who receive such GXO shares in the\n","distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\n","In addition, as part of and before the Separation, XPO and its subsidiaries completed an internal reorganization, and XPO, GXO and their respective subsidiaries incurred certain tax costs in\n","connection with the internal reorganization, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from transactions in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material. With respect to certain transactions undertaken\n","as part of the internal reorganization, XPO obtained opinions of external tax advisors regarding the tax treatment of such transactions. If any of these representations or statements is, or becomes,\n","inaccurate or incomplete, or if XPO, GXO or their respective subsidiaries do not fulfill or otherwise comply with any such undertakings or covenants, such opinions may be invalid or the conclusions\n","reached therein could be jeopardized. Further, notwithstanding receipt of any such tax opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of\n","the relevant transactions differs from the conclusions reached in the relevant tax opinions. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant transaction,\n","XPO, GXO and their subsidiaries could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\n","14\n","Risks Related to Our Common Stock\n","Any stockholder’s percentage of ownership in GXO may be diluted in the future at any given time.\n","In the future, existing holders of our common stock may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including any equity awards that we will\n","grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have stock-based awards that correspond to shares of our common stock after the Separation as a result of the conversion of their XPO\n","stock-based awards. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors has granted and is likely to continue to grant additional stock-based awards to our employees under our\n","employee benefits plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on the number of GXO shares outstanding and therefore on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of\n","our common stock.\n","Certain provisions in GXO’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of GXO, which could\n","decrease the trading price of GXO’s common stock.\n","Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and\n","inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a\n","hostile takeover. These provisions include:\n","•\n","the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n","•\n","limitations on stockholders’ ability to call a special stockholder meeting or act by written consent;\n","•\n","rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and\n","•\n","the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\n","In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (the “DGCL”), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. Section 203 provides that,\n","subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business\n","combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates\n","become the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock.\n","We believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing\n","our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make GXO immune from takeovers; however, these provisions will apply even if the\n","offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of GXO and our stockholders.\n","These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\n","In addition, in certain circumstances an acquisition or further issuance of our stock may trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, causing the Separation to be taxable to XPO. Under the\n","TMA, we are required to indemnify XPO for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.\n","GXO’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains an exclusive forum provision that may discourage lawsuits against GXO and GXO’s directors and officers.\n","Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within\n","the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of GXO,\n","any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a\n","15\n","fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer of GXO to GXO or to GXO stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, any\n","action asserting a claim against GXO or any current or former director or officer of GXO arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or\n","amended and restated bylaws, any action asserting a claim relating to or involving GXO governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is\n","defined in Section 115 of the DGCL.\n","To the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act and the\n","Exchange Act, although GXO stockholders will not be deemed to have waived GXO’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\n","This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with GXO or our directors or officers,\n","which may discourage such lawsuits against GXO or our directors or officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one\n","or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our\n","business, results of operations and financial condition.\n","Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n","None.\n","Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\n","We believe that cybersecurity is fundamental to how we operate and as such we focus on defining and managing our cybersecurity risk. With the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape and continual\n","emergence of new threats, our Board of Directors, Audit Committee and senior management team ensure that significant resources are devoted to cybersecurity risk management and the technologies,\n","processes and people that support it. We have an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, comprising senior leaders from key functions, and a Cybersecurity Risk Committee which utilize the\n","National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) framework to ensure that these risks are clearly and effectively categorized and treated.\n","We utilize comprehensive and widespread information sources and services (including third-party threat intelligence) to understand the threat landscape faced by the Company and design our\n","protective controls accordingly using a defense-in-depth approach. The layers of these defenses are aligned to the NIST framework; Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover. The Enterprise\n","Risk Management Committee and Cybersecurity Risk Management Committee meet regularly to consider any change to risk levels and ensure that the Company’s cybersecurity controls remain\n","commensurate to those risk levels.\n","The Company’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) is responsible for developing and implementing our cybersecurity program and reporting on related matters to our Board of Directors.\n","The CISO has over a decade of experience leading cybersecurity functions and over two decades in cybersecurity. The CISO leads a global team of highly trained experts covering all major\n","cybersecurity functions including Technical Engineering and Architecture, Governance Risk and Compliance, Security Operations and Incident Response, Threat and Vulnerability Management and\n","Security Awareness. The technologies, policies and processes associated with these functions are tested by third parties at least annually to ensure continued effectiveness and identify any\n","opportunities for improvement. These tests and assessments are useful tools for maintaining a robust cybersecurity program to protect our investors, customers, employees, vendors and intellectual\n","property.\n","A full suite of cybersecurity policies exists and is applicable to all employees globally. These policies are reviewed annually and approved by relevant senior leaders. All Company employees are\n","required to complete cybersecurity training annually, with quarterly “refreshers” throughout the year.\n","16\n","We invest in our cybersecurity defenses and have implemented multiple layers of protection against all known critical threats. We have high levels of compliance to protective controls on our\n","technical estate, robust perimeter defenses, industry-leading filtering and analysis of web and email traffic, widespread multi-factor authentication, continuous training of our employees through\n","educational material or simulation (e.g., phishing) and 24/7 monitoring of the IT estate. We have our own “red team” that is always searching our own environment for signs of vulnerability and have\n","a well-defined Cyber Incident Response Plan (“CIRP”) that is performed as a table-top exercise at least annually. A range of dashboards has been designed for use by the cybersecurity management\n","team to monitor the day-to-day performance of the cybersecurity defenses and immediately remediate any sign of concern.\n","All third-party vendors utilized by GXO undergo a cybersecurity assessment at the time of engagement. This assessment scrutinizes the third party’s cybersecurity maturity to ascertain the level of\n","risk the third party may present to the systems and data of GXO and its customers.\n","Our Audit Committee and our Board of Directors actively participate in discussions with management and among themselves regarding cybersecurity risks. In addition, our Board receives regular\n","cybersecurity reports, which include a review of key performance and risk indicators, test results and related remediation and recent threats and how the Company is managing those threats.\n","Despite the continuous risk faced by the Company, we have suffered no incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business\n","strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, nor have we had any widespread intrusion or incident. Notwithstanding the exhaustive approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be\n","successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our customers rely on us to move their goods with high efficiency through their supply chains — from the moment goods arrive at our warehouses\n","through fulfillment and distribution, and the management of returned products. Our customer base includes many blue-chip leaders in sectors that demonstrate high growth and/or durable demand,\n","with significant growth potential through customer outsourcing of logistics services.\n","We strive to provide all customers with consistent quality service and cutting-edge automation. We also collaborate with our largest customers on planning and forecasting and assist with network\n","optimization, working with these customers to design or redesign their supply chains to meet specific goals, such as environmental, social and governance. Our multidisciplinary, consultative\n","approach has led to many of our key customer relationships extending for years and expanding in scope.\n","The most dramatic growth in demand in recent years has been in e-commerce and related sectors, including omnichannel retail and other direct-to-consumer channels. We expect to attract new\n","customers and expand the services we provide to existing customers through new projects, thus earning more of their logistics spending. We use technology to manage advanced automation, labor\n","productivity, sustainability, safety and the complex flow of goods within sophisticated warehouse environments.\n","Our business model is asset-light and historically resilient in cycles, with high returns, strong free cash flow and visibility into revenue and earnings. The vast majority of our contracts with customers\n","are long-term in nature, and our warehouse lease arrangements generally align with contract length. The Company has both fixed-price contracts (closed book or hybrid contracts) and cost-plus\n","contracts (open book contracts). Most of our customer contracts contain both fixed and variable components. The fixed component is typically designed to cover warehouse, technology and\n","equipment costs, while the variable component is determined based on expected volumes and associated labor costs. Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work\n","for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company’s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, the Company will generate more or less profit. Cost-plus contracts\n","provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during the performance of the contract plus a specified margin.\n","20\n","Basis of Presentation\n","On August 2, 2021, the Company became a standalone publicly traded company and its financial statements post the separation from XPO, Inc. (the “Separation”) are now prepared on a consolidated\n","basis. Before the Separation, GXO’s historical financial statements were prepared on a standalone combined basis and were derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting\n","records of XPO. The combined Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented before the Separation are now referred to as “Consolidated Financial Statements” and have been prepared\n","under the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). GXO has one reportable segment.\n","On October 23, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of PFSweb, Inc. (“PFS”), an e-commerce order fulfillment company based in Irving, Texas (the “PFS Acquisition”). On May 24, 2022,\n","the Company completed the acquisition of Clipper Logistics plc (“Clipper”), an omnichannel retail logistics specialist based in Leeds, England (the “Clipper Acquisition”).

See Note 9. “Debt and Financing Arrangements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\n","information.\n","In addition, we have obligations for agreements to purchase goods or services entered into in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and gross unrecognized tax\n","benefits.\n","Critical Accounting Policies\n","We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. We make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,\n","expenses, gains and losses. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations. We have identified the following\n","accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their\n","application.\n","Business Combinations\n","We record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to\n","tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable\n","assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill.\n","Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities\n","assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful\n","lives of those acquired intangible assets. Significant assumptions utilized in the allocation of the purchase price related to intangible assets include future expected cash flows from acquired\n","intangibles and discount rates.\n","Our estimates of fair value are based upon reasonable assumptions but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from these estimates. During the\n","measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the\n","conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. See Note 4. “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n","Evaluation of Goodwill\n","We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or\n","one level below, on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying\n","value. We have three reporting units: i) Americas and Asia-Pacific, ii) United Kingdom and Ireland and iii) Continental Europe.\n","For each reporting unit, we first assess qualitative factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a\n","quantitative goodwill impairment test.\n","25\n","The qualitative factors could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a\n","reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\n","A quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, includes estimating the fair value of a reporting unit using the income and/or market approach. The income approach of determining fair\n","value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which requires us to make various assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth\n","rates and discount rates. The discount rates reflect management’s judgment and are based on a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of businesses similar to the\n","reporting units. Inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital\n","and tax rates. Our forecasts also reflect expectations concerning future economic conditions, interest rates and other market data. The market approach of determining fair value is based on\n","comparable market multiples for companies engaged in similar businesses, as well as recent transactions within our industry. We believe using these valuation techniques yields the most appropriate\n","evidence of the reporting unit’s fair value.\n","Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could\n","materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of any potential impairment.\n","Employee Benefit Plans\n","We sponsor various retirement plans, the most significant of which is in the U.K. (the “U.K. Retirement Plan”). Assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the\n","discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year at December 31. A change in any\n","of these assumptions would have an effect on the net periodic pension cost reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high-quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as\n","determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. A 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate of the U.K. Retirement Plan would result in an estimated increase in the accumulated benefit\n","obligation of approximately $44 million. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical\n","as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. An increase or decrease of 50 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return of the U.K. Retirement Plan would have decreased or\n","increased 2023 net periodic pension cost by approximately $4 million. See Note 14. “Employee Benefit Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n","New Accounting Standards\n","Information related to new accounting standards is included in Note 2. “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","26\n","Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n","Our market risk disclosures involve forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. We are exposed to market risk related\n","to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\n","Interest Rate Risk\n","Our long-term debt portfolio, excluding finance leases and other debt, consists of $800 million fixed-rate notes and $735 million variable-rate loans, complemented by a variable-rate revolving credit\n","facility. We use cross-currency swap agreements to convert $250 million of variable-rate debt from Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) to Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“Euribor”). We also\n","entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert $250 million of variable-rate U.S. dollar (“USD”)-denominated debt into USD-denominated fixed-rate debt. As of December 31, 2023, a\n","hypothetical 1% increase in Euribor would have increased our interest expense by approximately $3 million.\n","Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n","A significant proportion of our net assets and income is in non-USD currencies, primarily the Euro (“EUR”) and British pound sterling (“GBP”). We are exposed to currency risk from potential\n","changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows. Consequently, depreciation of the EUR or the GBP relative to the USD could have an\n","adverse impact on our financial results.\n","We entered into cross-currency swap agreements to manage our foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting a portion of the fixed-rate USD-denominated debt, including the interest\n","payments, to fixed-rate EUR-denominated debt and a portion of the floating-rate USD-denominated loans, including the interest payments, to floating-rate EUR-denominated debt. We use foreign\n","currency option contracts to mitigate the risk of a reduction in the value of earnings from our operations that use the EUR or GBP as their functional currency.\n","As of December 31, 2023, a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the USD relative to the EUR would have increased our net assets by approximately $67 million, net of hedging. As of\n","December 31, 2023, a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the USD relative to the GBP would have decreased our net assets by approximately $143 million, net of hedging. These theoretical\n","calculations assume that an instantaneous, parallel shift in exchange rates occurs, which is not consistent with the history of foreign currency markets. Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the\n","volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors’ services become more or less attractive. The sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does\n","not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices.\n","See Note 10. “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n","27\n","Item 8.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n","(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n","In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results\n","of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the\n","Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n","(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n","The Company acquired PFSweb, Inc. during 2023, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n","2023, PFSweb, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting associated with approximately 1.8% of total assets, excluding associated goodwill and intangible assets, and approximately 0.8% of total\n","revenues included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also\n","excluded an evaluation of the internal control over the financial reporting of PFSweb, Inc.\n","Basis for Opinions\n","The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\n","internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\n","Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\n","Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\n","applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n","We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\n","financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n","Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\n","and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n","Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial\n","statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\n","testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\n","29\n","audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n","Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n","A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements\n","for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\n","maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\n","recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\n","only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,\n","or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n","Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\n","to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n","Critical Audit Matter\n","The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the\n","audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\n","The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\n","matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n","Sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue from contracts with customers\n","As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided under the terms of the Company’s contractual\n","relationship with its customers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported $9.8 billion of revenue.\n","We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue from contracts with customers (revenue) as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment and IT professionals\n","with specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue due to the number and dispersion of warehouse management and other IT\n","systems used in the processing and recording of revenue.\n","The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over\n","the processing and recording of revenue. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the processing and recording of revenue, including\n","manual controls related to the examination of revenue contracts and detection of revenues recorded outside of expectations. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to\n","test certain manual and automated controls, including general IT controls, over multiple relevant IT systems and information used in internal control. We compared certain revenue activity\n","recorded during the year to cash received, adjusted for reconciling items. We evaluated the relevance and reliability of certain reconciling items to underlying documentation, including the\n","changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. We examined a selection of revenue contracts and transactions to assess that revenue was recorded in accordance with the Company’s\n","accounting policy. Additionally, for a sample of accrued revenue at year-end, we confirmed with the Company’s customers the amount of revenue billed subsequent to year-end and compared the\n","result to the Company’s accounting records. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence\n","30\n","obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.\n","/s/

Statements.\n","37\n","GXO Logistics, Inc.\n","Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n","1. Organization\n","Nature of Operations\n","GXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“GXO” or the “Company”), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world. The Company provides its customers with high-value-\n","added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services differentiated by its ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at\n","scale. The Company serves a broad range of customers across a range of industries, such as e-commerce, omnichannel retail, technology and consumer electronics, food and beverage, industrial and\n","manufacturing, and consumer packaged goods, among others. The Company presents its operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements as one reportable segment.\n","On August 2, 2021, the Company completed the separation (the “Separation”) from XPO, Inc. (“XPO”). The Separation was accomplished by the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common\n","stock of GXO to XPO stockholders as of the close of business on July 23, 2021, the record date for the distribution. XPO stockholders received one share of GXO common stock for every share of\n","XPO common stock held at the close of business on the record date. On August 2, 2021, GXO became a standalone publicly-traded company and regular-way trading of GXO’s common stock\n","commenced on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GXO.” GXO was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2021.\n","2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n","Basis of Presentation\n","Before the Separation, the Company’s financial statements were prepared on a standalone combined basis and were derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting records of\n","XPO (the “historical financial statements”). On August 2, 2021, the Company became a standalone publicly traded company, and its financial statements post-Separation are prepared on a\n","consolidated basis. The combined Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented before the Separation are now also referred to as “Consolidated Financial Statements” and have been\n","prepared under the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n","Before the Separation, the Company’s historical assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by XPO and were reflected on a historical cost basis. In connection with the Separation, the\n","Company’s assets and liabilities were transferred to the Company on a carry-over basis.\n","Before the Separation, the historical results of operations included allocations of XPO costs and expenses including XPO’s corporate function, which incurred a variety of expenses, including, but not\n","limited to, information technology, human resources, accounting, sales and sales operations, procurement, executive services, legal, corporate finance and communications. An allocation of these\n","expenses is included to burden all business units comprising XPO’s historical results of operations, including GXO. The charges reflected have been either specifically identified or allocated using\n","drivers including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which includes adjustments for transaction and integration costs, as well as restructuring costs and other\n","adjustments, or headcount. The majority of these allocated costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense; Depreciation and amortization expense; and Transaction and\n","integration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n","The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of GXO Logistics, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where the Company is the primary\n","beneficiary. The Company has eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions.\n","38\n","Use of Estimates\n","The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the Consolidated\n","Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the\n","circumstances. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, loss contingencies,\n","defined benefit plans, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives, collectability of accounts receivable and the fair value of\n","financial instruments. Actual results may vary from those estimates.\n","Significant Accounting Policies\n","Cash, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\n","The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Bank overdraft positions occur when total\n","outstanding issued checks exceed available cash balances at a single financial institution. Restricted cash is included within Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance sheets and consists\n","primarily of cash that collateralizes certain operating obligations.\n","Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\n","Accounts receivable represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive consideration from its customers. The Company records accounts receivable at the contractual amount and records an\n","allowance for doubtful accounts for the amount it estimates it may not collect. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers historical collection experience, the age of\n","the accounts receivable balances, the credit quality and risk of its customers, any specific customer collection issues, current economic conditions and other factors that may impact its customers’\n","ability to pay. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances once the receivables are no longer deemed collectible.\n","The roll forward of the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n","Year Ended December 31,\n","(In millions)\n","2023\n","2022\n","2021\n","Beginning balance\n","$\n","12 \n","$\n","13 \n","$\n","18 \n","Provisions charged to expense\n","10 \n","5 \n","4 \n","Write-offs, less recoveries, and other adjustments\n","(11)\n","(6)\n","(9)\n","Ending balance\n","$\n","11 \n","$\n","12 \n","$\n","13 \n","Property and Equipment\n","Property and equipment, which includes assets recorded under finance leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or, in the case of property and equipment acquired in a business\n","combination, at fair value at the date of acquisition. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expenses as incurred.\n","For internally developed computer software, all costs incurred during the planning and evaluation stages are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized once the preliminary\n","project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended.\n","Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Land and assets held within construction in\n","progress are not depreciated.\n","39\n","The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below:\n","Estimated Useful Life\n","Buildings\n","40 years\n","Leasehold improvements\n","Shorter of useful life or term of lease\n","Technology and automated systems\n","3 to 15 years\n","Warehouse equipment and other\n","3 to 15 years\n","Computer, software and equipment\n","1 to 5 years\n","Lease Obligations\n","The Company has operating leases primarily for real estate, warehouse equipment, material handling equipment, trucks, trailers and containers and finance leases for equipment. The Company\n","determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company recognizes lease assets and liabilities at the lease commencement date based on the\n","present value of the lease payments over the lease term.\n","For most of the Company’s leases, the implicit rate cannot be readily determined and, as a result, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates at the commencement date to determine the\n","present value of future lease payments. For leases that include fixed rental payments for both the use of the asset (“lease costs”) as well as for other occupancy or service costs relating to the asset\n","(“non-lease costs”), the Company generally includes both the lease costs and non-lease costs as a single lease component in the measurement of the lease asset and liability. Certain lease agreements\n","include rental payments based on changes in the consumer price index (“CPI”). Lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the CPI; instead, changes in the CPI are treated as variable\n","lease payments and are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. These payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred.\n","Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Lease expense is\n","recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably certain. Amounts received from a landlord are included as a reduction to the\n","lease asset and are included within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n","Long-lived assets geographic information\n","The Company’s long-lived assets for this disclosure is defined as Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, and operating lease assets. The Company’s long-lived assets by geographic\n","region were as follows:\n","December 31,\n","(In millions)\n","2023\n","2022\n","United States\n","$\n","1,545 \n","$\n","1,532 \n","United Kingdom\n","772 \n","834 \n","Other\n","837 \n","821 \n","Total\n","$\n","3,154 \n","$\n","3,187 \n","Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n","The Company records goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting\n","unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. The Company has three reporting units: i) Americas and Asia-Pacific, ii) United Kingdom and Ireland and iii) Continental Europe. The\n","Company measures goodwill impairment, if any, as the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\n","40\n","The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on November 1. The review of goodwill impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely\n","than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a one-step quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers many\n","factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including declines in the Company’s stock price, market capitalization of the Company and macroeconomic\n","conditions. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional\n","quantitative impairment testing is performed. The quantitative test requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting\n","unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). The Company uses the income approach and/or a market-\n","based approach to determine the reporting units’ fair values. The determination of discounted cash flows used in the income approach requires significant estimates and assumptions. Due to the\n","inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n","The Company’s intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, and developed technology which are amortized on a straight-line basis or over the period the economic\n","benefits are expected to be realized. The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be\n","recoverable.\n","Impairment of Long-lived Assets\n","The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held-and-used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If an\n","impairment indicator is present, the Company evaluates recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the\n","remaining useful life of a long-lived asset group. If the assets are impaired, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the\n","asset. The Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate consistent with the risks associated with the recovery of the asset.\n","Segment Reporting\n","The Company is comprised of three operating segments based on the operating results regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), who is the Chief Executive Officer\n","(“CEO”), to make decisions about resource allocation and the performance of the business. These three operating segments have been aggregated into a single reporting segment.\n","Revenue Recognition\n","The Company generates revenue by providing logistics services for its customers, including warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, reverse logistics, packaging and labeling, factory and\n","aftermarket support and inventory management ranging from a few months to a few years. Generally, the Company’s contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more\n","services, including but not limited to facility and equipment costs, construction, repair and maintenance services and labor. For these contracts, the Company does not consider the services to be\n","distinct within the context of the contract when the separate scopes of work combine into a single commercial objective or capability for the customer. Accordingly, the Company generally identifies\n","one performance obligation in its contracts, which is a series of distinct services that remain substantially the same over time and possess the same pattern of transfer.\n","Revenue is recognized using the series guidance over the period in which services are provided under the terms of the Company’s contractual relationships with its customers. The transaction price is\n","based on the amount specified in the contract with the customer and contains fixed and variable consideration. In general, the fixed consideration in a contract represents reimbursement for\n","warehouse, technology and equipment costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The variable consideration is\n","comprised of cost reimbursement based on the costs incurred, per-unit pricing is determined based\n","41\n","on units provided and time and materials pricing is based on the hours of services provided. The variable consideration component is recognized over time based on the level of activity. Generally,\n","pricing can be adjusted based on contractual provisions related to achieving agreed-upon performance metrics, changes in volumes, services and market conditions. Revenue relating to these pricing\n","adjustments is estimated and included in the consideration if it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in the future. The estimate of variable consideration is determined by the\n","expected value or most likely amount method and factors in current, past and forecasted experience with the customer. Customers are billed based on terms specified in the revenue contract and they\n","pay us according to approved payment terms.\n","Contract Assets and Liabilities\n","Contract assets consist of two components: customer acquisition costs and costs to fulfill a contract. The Company capitalizes direct and incremental costs incurred to obtain and to fulfill a contract in\n","advance of revenue recognition, such as certain labor, third-party service and related product costs. These costs are recognized as an asset if the Company expects to recover them. Contract assets are\n","recognized consistent with the transfer of the underlying performance obligations to the customer based on the specific contracts to which they relate. Contract assets are primarily amortized to Direct\n","operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the contract term.\n","Contract liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration or the amount that is due from the customer.\n","Derivative Instruments\n","The Company records all its derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as a hedge, and effective as\n","part of a hedge transaction, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income or as a basis adjustment to the\n","underlying hedged item and reclassified to earnings in the year in which the hedged item affects earnings. The effective portion of the gain or loss on hedges of foreign net investments is generally\n","not reclassified to earnings unless the net investment is disposed. To the extent derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedges, or are ineffective, their changes in fair value are recorded in\n","earnings immediately, which may subject us to increased earnings volatility.\n","Stock-Based Compensation\n","The Company accounts for stock-based compensation based on the equity instrument’s grant date fair value. Stock compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line method, based on the\n","grant date fair value, over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. For grants of restricted stock units (“RSU”) subject to service-based or performance-based\n","vesting conditions only, the Company establishes the fair value based on the market price on the date of the grant. For grants of awards subject to market-based vesting conditions (“PSU”), the\n","Company determines the fair value based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n","Earnings per Share\n","Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted\n","earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive stock awards that were outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential\n","exercise of stock-based awards when the effect of the potential exercise would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the number of common shares excluded from\n","diluted shares outstanding was 1.5 million, 2.0 million and 0.1 million, respectively, because the effect of including those common shares in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.\n","42\n","On August 2, 2021, the date of the Separation, 114.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock were distributed to XPO stockholders. These 114.6 million shares have been utilized for the\n","calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods prior to the date of the Separation as no shares of common stock or equity-based awards of the Company were outstanding before that\n","date.\n","Defined Benefit Plans\n","The Company calculates its employer-sponsored retirement plan obligations using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Assumptions include discount rates, expected long-term rate of\n","return on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors. The assumptions used in recording the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets represent the Company’s best estimates based\n","on available information regarding historical experience and factors that may cause future expectations to differ. The Company’s obligation and future expense amounts could be materially impacted\n","by differences in experience or changes in assumptions.\n","The Company determines the net periodic benefit cost of the plans using assumptions regarding the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year. Net\n","periodic benefit cost is recorded within Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company calculates the funded status of the defined benefit plan as the difference between\n","the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets.\n","The impact of plan amendments, actuarial gains and losses and prior-service costs are recorded in AOCIL and are generally amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the remaining\n","service period of the active employees covered by the defined benefit pension plans. Cumulative gains and losses over 10% of the greater of the beginning of year benefit obligation or fair value of\n","the plan assets are amortized over the expected average life expectancy.\n","Income Taxes\n","The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis, under which the Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable\n","for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. The calculation\n","of the annual effective tax rate relies on several factors including pre-tax earnings, various jurisdiction statutory tax rates, tax credits, uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances and differences\n","between tax laws and accounting laws. The effective tax rate in any financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the blend and/or level of earnings by individual taxing\n","jurisdictions.\n","If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, presuming an examination by a taxing authority\n","with full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company recognizes all or a portion of the benefit. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that the Company’s\n","deferred tax assets will not be realized based on all available evidence.\n","The Company uses judgments and estimates in evaluating its tax positions. The Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by U.S. Federal, state and local and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The\n","Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years. The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax\n","positions only if based on the technical merits of the position it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit. The Company adjusts these tax liabilities, including related\n","interest and penalties, based on the current facts and circumstances. The Company reports tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\n","43\n","Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions\n","The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that use their local currency as their functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars (“USD”) using the exchange rate prevailing at\n","each balance sheet date, with balance sheet currency translation adjustments recorded in AOCIL in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company converts foreign currency transactions recognized\n","in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to USD by applying the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the\n","effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n","Adoption of New Accounting Standards\n","In 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\n","Reporting.” The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are\n","met. The ASU applies only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate\n","reform. In 2021, the FASB expanded the scope of the guidance to include derivatives. On March 9, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to its revolving credit facility replacing\n","LIBOR-based benchmark rates with SOFR-based benchmark rates and other conforming changes (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Company has transitioned its existing contracts to a\n","replacement index. ASU 2020-04 and its amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\n","In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\n","Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and\n","interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The\n","Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which provides for expanded disclosures primarily related to income taxes\n","paid and the rate reconciliation. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption and retrospective application are permitted.\n","The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n","44\n","3.

The Company estimates remaining performance obligations at a point in time and actual amounts may differ\n","from these estimates due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and contract revisions or terminations.\n","4. Acquisitions\n","PFSweb Acquisition\n","On September 13, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire PFSweb, Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas (“PFS”), and on October 23,\n","2023, the Company completed its acquisition of PFS (the “PFS Acquisition”). The Company acquired the shares of PFS at a price per share of $7.50 in cash, totaling approximately $149 million, net\n","of cash acquired. PFS is a global provider of omnichannel commerce solutions, including a broad range of technology, infrastructure and professional services, in the United States, Canada and\n","Europe. PFS’s service offerings include order fulfillment, fulfillment-as-a-service, order management and customer care.\n","The Company recorded the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition, including intangible assets comprising customer relationships, trademarks, trade\n","names and developed technology of $56 million with a weighted-average amortization period of 13 years. Goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition was $76 million, recorded in the\n","Americas and Asia-Pacific reporting unit, and was attributed to anticipated synergies. The Company expects to finalize the purchase price allocation within the measurement period, which will not\n","exceed one year from the acquisition date. The Company does not expect the goodwill recognized in connection with the PFS Acquisition to be deductible for income tax purposes.\n","For the year ended December 31, 2023, PFS generated revenues of $82 million and income before income taxes was not material.

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n","Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The Company uses\n","derivative instruments to manage the volatility related to these exposures. The objective of these derivative instruments is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in\n","foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company does not expect to incur any losses as a result of\n","counterparty default.\n","Net Investment Hedges\n","The Company uses fixed-to-fixed or variable-to-variable cross-currency swap agreements to hedge its net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the\n","U.S. dollar and the associated foreign currencies. The Company designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and accounts for them as net investment hedges.\n","In October 2023, the Company terminated a hedge with a notional amount of $115 million and amended a $235 million hedge to extend its maturity from 2024 to 2025.

The Company designated these interest rate swap agreements\n","as qualifying hedging instruments and accounts for them as cash flow hedges. When an interest rate swap agreement qualifies for hedge accounting as a cash flow hedge, the changes in the fair value\n","are recorded in equity as a component of AOCIL and are reclassified into Interest expense, net over the life of the underlying debt, as interest on the Company’s floating rate debt is accrued. In\n","January 2024, the Company entered into an interest rate swap schedule to mature in 2025, with a notional amount of $125 million.\n","Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n","The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company uses foreign currency option contracts to mitigate\n","the risk of a reduction in the value of earnings from its operations that use the Euro or British pound sterling as their functional currency. Additionally, the Company uses foreign currency forward\n","contracts to mitigate exposure from variability of cash flows related to the forecasted interest and principal payments on intercompany loans. The foreign currency forward contracts generally expire\n","within 12 months. While these derivatives are hedging the fluctuations in foreign currencies, they do not meet the requirements to be accounted for as hedging instruments.\n","54\n","Derivatives\n","The notional amount and fair value of derivative instruments were as follows:\n","December 31,\n","2023\n","2022\n","(In millions)\n","Notional Amount\n","Fair Value\n","Notional Amount\n","Fair Value\n","Balance Sheet Location\n","Derivatives designated as hedges\n","Assets:\n","Interest rate swaps\n","$\n","125 \n","$\n","2 \n","$\n","— \n","$\n","— \n","Other current assets\n","Interest rate swaps\n","125 \n","3 \n","250 \n","9 \n","Other long-term assets\n","Cross-currency swap agreements\n","487 \n","3 \n","1,222 \n","22 \n","Other long-term assets\n","Liabilities:\n","Cross-currency swap agreements\n","$\n","165 \n","$\n","7 \n","$\n","115 \n","$\n","13 \n","Other current liabilities\n","Cross-currency swap agreements\n","883 \n","49 \n","— \n","— \n","Other long-term liabilities\n","Derivatives not designated as hedges\n","Assets:\n","Foreign currency option contracts\n","$\n","397 \n","$\n","8 \n","$\n","— \n","$\n","— \n","Other current assets\n","Foreign currency forward contracts\n","1 \n","— \n","— \n","— \n","Other current assets\n","Liabilities:\n","Foreign currency option contracts\n","$\n","— \n","$\n","— \n","$\n","354 \n","$\n","5 \n","Other current liabilities\n","Foreign currency forward contracts\n","— \n","— \n","3 \n","— \n","Other current liabilities\n","As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the derivatives were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

If a loss is not both probable and reasonably estimable, or if an exposure to a loss exists\n","in excess of the amount accrued, the Company assesses whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional loss, may have been incurred. If there is a reasonable possibility that a\n","loss, or additional loss, may have been incurred, the Company discloses the estimate of the possible loss or range of loss if it is material and an estimate can be made, or discloses that such an estimate\n","cannot be made. The determination as to whether a loss can reasonably be considered to be possible or probable is based on management’s assessment, together with legal counsel, regarding the\n","ultimate outcome of the matter.\n","Management of the Company believes that it has adequately accrued for the potential impact of loss contingencies that are probable and reasonably estimable. Management of the Company does not\n","believe that the ultimate resolution of any matters to which the Company is presently a party will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n","However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial\n","condition, results of operations or cash flows. Legal costs related to these matters are expensed as they are incurred.\n","The Company carries liability and excess umbrella insurance policies that are deemed sufficient to cover potential legal claims arising in the normal course of conducting its operations.

Definitions For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply: “Bonus” means any cash bonus or annual bonus. “Compensation Agreement” means any Covered Executive's employment agreement, severance agreement, or offer letter. “Covenant Breach” means a breach of any applicable restrictive covenant in any Compensation Agreement or other agreement between the Covered Executive and GXO or any of GXO’s affiliates. “Covered Executive” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company’s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. An “executive officer” for purposes of this Policy includes at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of SEC Regulation S- K. Covered Executive also includes any other employee of the Company and its\n","subsidiaries designated by the Committee from time to time by notice to the employee. “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid. For incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement: (i) the amount shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the incentive-based compensation was received; and (ii) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange.\n"," \n","-2- 71533835;8 “Exchange” means the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are then listed. “Exchange Act” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. “Financial Reporting Measure” means any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from those measures, whether or not the measure is presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC, such as stock price, total shareholder return, revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and free cash flows. “For Cause Termination” means any termination of a Covered Executive’s employment for “cause,” as defined in the Covered Executive’s Compensation Agreement, or if the Covered Executive is not party to a Compensation Agreement, as such term is defined in the GXO Logistics, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as may be amended or restated from time to time, or any successor plan. “Incentive Compensation” means any compensation that is awarded, earned or vested based in whole or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure.

Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, the Company shall have the remedies set forth below: (i) A Covered Executive has engaged in any Misconduct; (ii) A Covered Executive’s experiences a For Cause Termination; (iii) A Covered Executive commits a Covenant Breach; or (iv) The Company is required to prepare a Restatement. Misconduct, For Cause Termination and Covenant Breaches - LTI Awards. The Company may (i) in the case of a For Cause Termination, at any time from two years before and up to six months after such termination, or (ii) in the case of Misconduct or a Covenant Breach, at any time from two years before and up to six months after learning of such conduct or breach, but in no event more than two years after the Covered Executive engages in such conduct or breach: terminate or cancel any LTI Awards held by the Covered Executive that are unvested or vested and unexercised; require the Covered Executive to forfeit or remit to the Company any amount payable, or the after-tax net amount paid or received by the Covered Executive, in respect of any LTI Awards the vesting of which was accelerated upon termination of the Covered Executive’s employment for any reason; and/or require the Covered Executive to forfeit or remit to the Company any shares of Company common stock (or the equivalent value in cash) that were issued to the Covered Executive (or cash that was paid to the Covered Executive) upon vesting, settlement or exercise, as applicable, of any LTI Award; provided, however, that, in cases where cure is possible, the Covered Executive shall first be provided a fifteen-day cure period to cease, and\n","to cure, such conduct. Misconduct - Annual Bonuses. In the event of Misconduct, the Company may recover the amount by which any compensation paid to the Covered Executive exceeded the lower amount that would have been payable after accounting for the applicable material loss or such other amount as determined to be appropriate by the Committee, by: requiring repayment by the Covered Executive of any Bonus previously paid, net of any taxes paid by the Covered Executive on such Bonus; or cancelling any earned but unpaid Bonus; and/or\n"," \n","-4- 71533835;8 adjusting the Covered Executive’s future compensation in order to recover an appropriate amount with respect to the restated financial results or the material loss. Restatements. In the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company will recover reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by the Covered Executive. If the Committee cannot determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the accounting restatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement. Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation will apply to any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received on or after October 2, 2023 by a Covered Executive: After beginning service as a Covered Executive; Who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation; While the Company has a class of securities listed on the Exchange; and During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company was required to prepare the Restatement (including any transition period within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year, determined in accordance with the rules of the Exchange). However, a transition period between the last day of the Company’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year. The Company’s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed. For purposes of determining the relevant recovery period, the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement is the earlier to occur of: the date on which the Board, a\n","committee thereof or the Company’s officer(s) authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement; and the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may, in its discretion, seek recoupment of any excess Incentive Compensation from a Covered Executive from any of the following sources: (1) prior Incentive Compensation payments; (2) future payments of Incentive Compensation; (3) cancellation of outstanding Incentive Compensation; and (4) direct repayment. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may offset such amount against any compensation or other amounts owed by the Company to the Covered Executive. Covered Executives This Policy applies to the Company’s Covered Executives.\n"," \n","-5- 71533835;8 Mandatory Disclosure The Company shall file this Policy and, in the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, will disclose information related to such Restatement in accordance with applicable law, including, for the avoidance of doubt, Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act or any rules or standards adopted by the Exchange. Administration This Policy shall be administered by the Committee. Any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals, and need not be uniform with respect to Covered Executives. The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. This policy is intended to comply with Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 thereunder, and the applicable rules of the Exchange, and will be interpreted and administered consistent with that intent. Amendment; Termination The Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act, or any rules or standards adopted by the Exchange. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Other Recoupment Rights Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any Compensation Agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal or equitable remedies available to the Company. Without\n","limiting the foregoing, the provisions of this Policy are in addition to (and not in lieu of) any rights to repayment the Company may have under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (applicable to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer only) and other applicable laws. Limited Exceptions to Recovery Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its discretion, may choose to forgo recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the following circumstances, on the condition that the Committee (or a majority of the independent members of the Board) has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable because: the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this policy would exceed the recoverable amounts, and in which case the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, has documented that attempt and has (to the extent required) provided that documentation to the Exchange; or\n"," \n","-6- 71533835;8 recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax‐qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company shall obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation, and shall provide such opinion to the Exchange. No Indemnification; No Liability The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, nor shall the Company directly or indirectly pay or reimburse any Covered Executive for any premiums for third-party insurance policies that such Covered Executive may elect to purchase to fund such Covered Executive’s potential obligations under this Policy. None of the Company, an affiliate of the Company or any member of the Committee or the Board shall have any liability to any Covered Executive as a result of actions taken under this Policy. Successors This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n"," \n","-7- 71533835;8 ATTESTATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF AMENDED AND RESTATED CLAWBACK POLICY By my signature below, I acknowledge and agree that: I have received and read the attached Amended and Restated Clawback Policy (this “Policy”).

Business.\\nCompany Overview\\nGXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“GXO,” the “Company,” “our” or “we”), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world and a foremost innovator in an industry', 'propelled by strong secular tailwinds. We provide our customers with high-value-added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services\\ndifferentiated by our ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at scale. As of December\\xa031, 2023, our 131,000 team members operated in 974 facilities worldwide totaling 199', 'million square feet of space, primarily on behalf of large corporations that have outsourced their warehousing, distribution and other related activities to us.\\nOur revenue is diversified among over one thousand customers, including many multinational corporations, across numerous verticals. Our customers rely on us to move their goods, with high', 'efficiency, through their supply chains — from the moment goods arrive at our warehouses through fulfillment and distribution, and the management of returned products. Our customer base includes\\nmany blue-chip leaders in sectors that demonstrate high growth and/or durable demand, with significant growth potential through customer outsourcing of logistics services.', 'GXO became a standalone publicly traded company on August 2, 2021, when GXO completed its separation (the “Separation”) from XPO, Inc. (“XPO”) and began regular-way trading on the New\\nYork Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GXO.” GXO was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2021.\\nOur Strategy', 'Our Strategy\\nWe design and operate the most advanced warehouse solutions in the world. Our strategy is to help our customers manage their warehouse needs for optimal efficiency, using our network of people,\\ntechnology and other physical assets. We deliver value to customers in the form of technological innovations, process efficiencies, cost efficiencies and reliable outcomes. Our services are highly', 'responsive to customer goals, such as increasing visibility in the supply chain, decreasing fulfillment times and mitigating environmental impacts, while being proactive in identifying potential\\nimprovements.\\nGXO creates short- and long-term value for customers and shareholders through our unique combination of technology, scale and expertise. Our strategy addresses growth and optimization by', 'focusing on core verticals that demonstrate enduring demand over time and where we already have a deep presence. We expect to attract new customers and expand the services we provide to\\nexisting customers through new projects, thus earning more of their logistics spend. We integrate best practices to drive productivity, with a focus on automation and other levers of profitable growth.', 'To aid in executing our strategy, we have instilled a culture that focuses on delivering mutually beneficial results for our customers and our company with the highest legal and ethical standards and\\nclear policies and practices to support compliance throughout our organization.\\nTechnology and Intellectual Property', 'Technology and Intellectual Property\\nContract logistics is becoming more and more complex, as changing consumer expectations and preferences continue to drive a need for faster delivery times, higher levels of returned inventory and\\nbetter visibility throughout the supply chain. Traditional warehousing solutions are no longer sufficient to fill these needs. The industry needs scaled technology players, like GXO, to deliver these\\ncomplex solutions.', 'complex solutions.\\nTechnology is a core competitive advantage for GXO and fundamental to how we win and retain business. GXO was an early adopter of technology, and more than 30% of our warehouses are\\ntechnology-enabled compared to the industry average of approximately 10%. Technology enables us to add value to our customers’ end-to-end\\n1\\noperations in terms of cost, efficiency, accuracy and environmental impact. Investments in cutting-edge technology are a major growth driver for our business.', 'Our highly scalable warehouse management platform is built on the cloud to speed the deployment of new ways to increase efficiency and leverage our footprint.

Importantly, automation also enhances safety and the overall quality\\nof employment. Our warehouse management system creates a synchronized environment across automation platforms to control these technologies holistically, providing an integrated solution.', 'We have found that autonomous goods-to-person systems and cobots, which assist workers with the inventory picking process, can improve labor productivity. Stationary robot arms can repeat\\ndemanding tasks with greater precision than is possible manually. Robots are particularly valuable in markets with labor shortages and where wage inflation can erode customer margins.', 'Other technologies that differentiate our logistics environments are our proprietary warehouse module for order management, which gives customers deep visibility into fulfillment flows, and our\\nanalytics dashboard, which gives customers valuable business intelligence to manage their supply chains. Our connection management software module facilitates integration with SAP, Oracle and\\nother external systems, enabling our customers to get the maximum benefit from our technology.', 'Predictive Analytics\\nOur predictive analytics add significant value for customers, particularly in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, where seasonality drives high volumes through outbound and inbound logistics\\nprocesses. For example, up to 30% of consumer goods bought online are returned, and this creates increased volumes at certain times of the year. We have developed analytics that predict surges in\\ndemand using a combination of historical data and customer forecasting.', 'As an industry leader that invests substantially in technology, we have access to an immense amount of data, as well as the analytical processing capabilities to capitalize on that data by incorporating\\nour learnings into customer solutions.

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to\\ntangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable\\nassets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill.', 'assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill.\\nAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities\\nassumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful', 'lives of those acquired intangible assets. Significant assumptions utilized in the allocation of the purchase price related to intangible assets include future expected cash flows from acquired\\nintangibles and discount rates.\\nOur estimates of fair value are based upon reasonable assumptions but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from these estimates. During the', 'measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

See Note 4. “Acquisitions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nEvaluation of Goodwill', 'Evaluation of Goodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or\\none level below, on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying', 'value. We have three reporting units: i) Americas and Asia-Pacific, ii) United Kingdom and Ireland and iii) Continental Europe.\\nFor each reporting unit, we first assess qualitative factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a\\nquantitative goodwill impairment test.\\n25', 'quantitative goodwill impairment test.\\n25\\nThe qualitative factors could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a\\nreporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.', 'A quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, includes estimating the fair value of a reporting unit using the income and/or market approach. The income approach of determining fair\\nvalue is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, which requires us to make various assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth', 'rates and discount rates. The discount rates reflect management’s judgment and are based on a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of businesses similar to the\\nreporting units. Inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital', 'and tax rates. Our forecasts also reflect expectations concerning future economic conditions, interest rates and other market data. The market approach of determining fair value is based on\\ncomparable market multiples for companies engaged in similar businesses, as well as recent transactions within our industry. We believe using these valuation techniques yields the most appropriate\\nevidence of the reporting unit’s fair value.', 'evidence of the reporting unit’s fair value.\\nMany of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could\\nmaterially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of any potential impairment.\\nEmployee Benefit Plans', 'Employee Benefit Plans\\nWe sponsor various retirement plans, the most significant of which is in the U.K. (the “U.K. Retirement Plan”). Assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the\\ndiscount rate and expected return on plan assets. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year at December 31. A change in any', 'of these assumptions would have an effect on the net periodic pension cost reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nThe discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high-quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as', 'determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. A 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate of the U.K. Retirement Plan would result in an estimated increase in the accumulated benefit\\nobligation of approximately $44\\xa0million. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical', 'as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. An increase or decrease of 50 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return of the U.K. Retirement Plan would have decreased or\\nincreased 2023 net periodic pension cost by approximately $4\\xa0million.

Consolidated Financial Statements\\n1. Organization\\nNature of Operations\\nGXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“GXO” or the “Company”), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world. The Company provides its customers with high-value-', 'added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services differentiated by its ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at\\nscale. The Company serves a broad range of customers across a range of industries, such as e-commerce, omnichannel retail, technology and consumer electronics, food and beverage, industrial and', 'manufacturing, and consumer packaged goods, among others. The Company presents its operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements as one reportable segment.\\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company completed the separation (the “Separation”) from XPO, Inc. (“XPO”). The Separation was accomplished by the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common', 'stock of GXO to XPO stockholders as of the close of business on July 23, 2021, the record date for the distribution. XPO stockholders received one share of GXO common stock for every share of\\nXPO common stock held at the close of business on the record date. On August 2, 2021, GXO became a standalone publicly-traded company and regular-way trading of GXO’s common stock', 'commenced on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GXO.” GXO was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2021.\\n2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation\\nBefore the Separation, the Company’s financial statements were prepared on a standalone combined basis and were derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting records of', 'XPO (the “historical financial statements”). On August 2, 2021, the Company became a standalone publicly traded company, and its financial statements post-Separation are prepared on a\\nconsolidated basis. The combined Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented before the Separation are now also referred to as “Consolidated Financial Statements” and have been\\nprepared under the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).', 'Before the Separation, the Company’s historical assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by XPO and were reflected on a historical cost basis. In connection with the Separation, the\\nCompany’s assets and liabilities were transferred to the Company on a carry-over basis.\\nBefore the Separation, the historical results of operations included allocations of XPO costs and expenses including XPO’s corporate function, which incurred a variety of expenses, including, but not', 'limited to, information technology, human resources, accounting, sales and sales operations, procurement, executive services, legal, corporate finance and communications. An allocation of these\\nexpenses is included to burden all business units comprising XPO’s historical results of operations, including GXO. The charges reflected have been either specifically identified or allocated using', 'drivers including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which includes adjustments for transaction and integration costs, as well as restructuring costs and other\\nadjustments, or headcount. The majority of these allocated costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense; Depreciation and amortization expense; and Transaction and\\nintegration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.', 'The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of GXO Logistics, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where the Company is the primary\\nbeneficiary. The Company has eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions.\\n38\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the Consolidated', 'Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the\\ncircumstances. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, income taxes, loss contingencies,', 'defined benefit plans, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives, collectability of accounts receivable and the fair value of\\nfinancial instruments. Actual results may vary from those estimates.\\nSignificant Accounting Policies\\nCash, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents', 'Cash, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Bank overdraft positions occur when total\\noutstanding issued checks exceed available cash balances at a single financial institution. Restricted cash is included within Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance sheets and consists', 'primarily of cash that collateralizes certain operating obligations.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\\nAccounts receivable represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive consideration from its customers. The Company records accounts receivable at the contractual amount and records an', 'allowance for doubtful accounts for the amount it estimates it may not collect. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers historical collection experience, the age of\\nthe accounts receivable balances, the credit quality and risk of its customers, any specific customer collection issues, current economic conditions and other factors that may impact its customers’', 'ability to pay. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances once the receivables are no longer deemed collectible.\\nThe roll forward of the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n(In millions)\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nBeginning balance\\n$\\n12\\xa0\\n$\\n13\\xa0\\n$\\n18\\xa0\\nProvisions charged to expense\\n10\\xa0\\n5\\xa0\\n4\\xa0\\nWrite-offs, less recoveries, and other adjustments\\n(11)\\n(6)\\n(9)\\nEnding balance\\n$\\n11\\xa0\\n$\\n12\\xa0\\n$\\n13\\xa0\\nProperty and Equipment', '$\\n11\\xa0\\n$\\n12\\xa0\\n$\\n13\\xa0\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment, which includes assets recorded under finance leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or, in the case of property and equipment acquired in a business\\ncombination, at fair value at the date of acquisition. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expenses as incurred.', 'For internally developed computer software, all costs incurred during the planning and evaluation stages are expensed as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized once the preliminary\\nproject stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended.', 'Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Land and assets held within construction in\\nprogress are not depreciated.\\n39\\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below:\\nEstimated Useful Life\\nBuildings\\n40 years\\nLeasehold improvements\\nShorter of useful life or term of lease\\nTechnology and automated systems\\n3 to 15 years\\nWarehouse equipment and other\\n3 to 15 years', 'Warehouse equipment and other\\n3 to 15 years\\nComputer, software and equipment\\n1 to 5 years\\nLease Obligations\\nThe Company has operating leases primarily for real estate, warehouse equipment, material handling equipment, trucks, trailers and containers and finance leases for equipment. The Company\\ndetermines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company recognizes lease assets and liabilities at the lease commencement date based on the', 'present value of the lease payments over the lease term.\\nFor most of the Company’s leases, the implicit rate cannot be readily determined and, as a result, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates at the commencement date to determine the\\npresent value of future lease payments. For leases that include fixed rental payments for both the use of the asset (“lease costs”) as well as for other occupancy or service costs relating to the asset', '(“non-lease costs”), the Company generally includes both the lease costs and non-lease costs as a single lease component in the measurement of the lease asset and liability. Certain lease agreements\\ninclude rental payments based on changes in the consumer price index (“CPI”). Lease liabilities are not remeasured as a result of changes in the CPI; instead, changes in the CPI are treated as variable', 'lease payments and are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. These payments are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred.\\nLease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Lease expense is', 'recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably certain. Amounts received from a landlord are included as a reduction to the\\nlease asset and are included within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\\nLong-lived assets geographic information', 'Long-lived assets geographic information\\nThe Company’s long-lived assets for this disclosure is defined as Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, and operating lease assets. The Company’s long-lived assets by geographic\\nregion were as follows:\\nDecember 31,\\n(In millions)\\n2023\\n2022\\nUnited States\\n$\\n1,545\\xa0\\n$\\n1,532\\xa0\\nUnited Kingdom\\n772\\xa0\\n834\\xa0\\nOther\\n837\\xa0\\n821\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n3,154\\xa0\\n$\\n3,187\\xa0\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets', '$\\n3,154\\xa0\\n$\\n3,187\\xa0\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nThe Company records goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting\\nunit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. The Company has three reporting units: i) Americas and Asia-Pacific, ii) United Kingdom and Ireland and iii) Continental Europe. The', 'Company measures goodwill impairment, if any, as the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\\n40\\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on November 1. The review of goodwill impairment consists of either using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely', 'than not that the fair value of the assets is less than their respective carrying values or a one-step quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers many\\nfactors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, including declines in the Company’s stock price, market capitalization of the Company and macroeconomic', 'conditions. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional\\nquantitative impairment testing is performed. The quantitative test requires that the carrying value of each reporting unit be compared with its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting', 'unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill). The Company uses the income approach and/or a market-\\nbased approach to determine the reporting units’ fair values. The determination of discounted cash flows used in the income approach requires significant estimates and assumptions. Due to the\\ninherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.', 'The Company’s intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, and developed technology which are amortized on a straight-line basis or over the period the economic\\nbenefits are expected to be realized. The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be\\nrecoverable.\\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets', 'recoverable.\\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to be held-and-used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If an\\nimpairment indicator is present, the Company evaluates recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the', 'remaining useful life of a long-lived asset group. If the assets are impaired, an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the\\nasset. The Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate consistent with the risks associated with the recovery of the asset.\\nSegment Reporting', 'Segment Reporting\\nThe Company is comprised of three operating segments based on the operating results regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”), who is the Chief Executive Officer\\n(“CEO”), to make decisions about resource allocation and the performance of the business. These three operating segments have been aggregated into a single reporting segment.\\nRevenue Recognition', 'Revenue Recognition\\nThe Company generates revenue by providing logistics services for its customers, including warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, reverse logistics, packaging and labeling, factory and\\naftermarket support and inventory management ranging from a few months to a few years. Generally, the Company’s contracts provide the customer an integrated service that includes two or more', 'services, including but not limited to facility and equipment costs, construction, repair and maintenance services and labor. For these contracts, the Company does not consider the services to be\\ndistinct within the context of the contract when the separate scopes of work combine into a single commercial objective or capability for the customer. Accordingly, the Company generally identifies', 'one performance obligation in its contracts, which is a series of distinct services that remain substantially the same over time and possess the same pattern of transfer.\\nRevenue is recognized using the series guidance over the period in which services are provided under the terms of the Company’s contractual relationships with its customers. The transaction price is', 'based on the amount specified in the contract with the customer and contains fixed and variable consideration. In general, the fixed consideration in a contract represents reimbursement for\\nwarehouse, technology and equipment costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The variable consideration is\\ncomprised of cost reimbursement based on the costs incurred, per-unit pricing is determined based\\n41', '41\\non units provided and time and materials pricing is based on the hours of services provided. The variable consideration component is recognized over time based on the level of activity. Generally,\\npricing can be adjusted based on contractual provisions related to achieving agreed-upon performance metrics, changes in volumes, services and market conditions. Revenue relating to these pricing', 'adjustments is estimated and included in the consideration if it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in the future. The estimate of variable consideration is determined by the\\nexpected value or most likely amount method and factors in current, past and forecasted experience with the customer. Customers are billed based on terms specified in the revenue contract and they\\npay us according to approved payment terms.\\nContract Assets and Liabilities', 'Contract Assets and Liabilities\\nContract assets consist of two components: customer acquisition costs and costs to fulfill a contract. The Company capitalizes direct and incremental costs incurred to obtain and to fulfill a contract in\\nadvance of revenue recognition, such as certain labor, third-party service and related product costs. These costs are recognized as an asset if the Company expects to recover them. Contract assets are', 'recognized consistent with the transfer of the underlying performance obligations to the customer based on the specific contracts to which they relate. Contract assets are primarily amortized to Direct\\noperating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the contract term.\\nContract liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to transfer services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration or the amount that is due from the customer.\\nDerivative Instruments', 'Derivative Instruments\\nThe Company records all its derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as a hedge, and effective as\\npart of a hedge transaction, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income or as a basis adjustment to the', 'underlying hedged item and reclassified to earnings in the year in which the hedged item affects earnings. The effective portion of the gain or loss on hedges of foreign net investments is generally\\nnot reclassified to earnings unless the net investment is disposed. To the extent derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedges, or are ineffective, their changes in fair value are recorded in\\nearnings immediately, which may subject us to increased earnings volatility.', 'Stock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation based on the equity instrument’s grant date fair value. Stock compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line method, based on the\\ngrant date fair value, over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. For grants of restricted stock units (“RSU”) subject to service-based or performance-based', 'vesting conditions only, the Company establishes the fair value based on the market price on the date of the grant. For grants of awards subject to market-based vesting conditions (“PSU”), the\\nCompany determines the fair value based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\\nEarnings per Share', 'Earnings per Share\\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted\\nearnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive stock awards that were outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential', 'exercise of stock-based awards when the effect of the potential exercise would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the number of common shares excluded from\\ndiluted shares outstanding was 1.5\\xa0million, 2.0\\xa0million and 0.1\\xa0million, respectively, because the effect of including those common shares in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.\\n42', '42\\nOn August 2, 2021, the date of the Separation, 114.6\\xa0million shares of the Company’s common stock were distributed to XPO stockholders. These 114.6\\xa0million shares have been utilized for the\\ncalculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods prior to the date of the Separation as no shares of common stock or equity-based awards of the Company were outstanding before that\\ndate.\\nDefined Benefit Plans', 'date.\\nDefined Benefit Plans\\nThe Company calculates its employer-sponsored retirement plan obligations using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Assumptions include discount rates, expected long-term rate of\\nreturn on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors. The assumptions used in recording the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets represent the Company’s best estimates based', 'on available information regarding historical experience and factors that may cause future expectations to differ. The Company’s obligation and future expense amounts could be materially impacted\\nby differences in experience or changes in assumptions.\\nThe Company determines the net periodic benefit cost of the plans using assumptions regarding the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year. Net', 'periodic benefit cost is recorded within Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company calculates the funded status of the defined benefit plan as the difference between\\nthe projected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets.\\nThe impact of plan amendments, actuarial gains and losses and prior-service costs are recorded in AOCIL and are generally amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the remaining', 'service period of the active employees covered by the defined benefit pension plans. Cumulative gains and losses over 10% of the greater of the beginning of year benefit obligation or fair value of\\nthe plan assets are amortized over the expected average life expectancy.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method on a legal entity and jurisdictional basis, under which the Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable', 'for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. The calculation\\nof the annual effective tax rate relies on several factors including pre-tax earnings, various jurisdiction statutory tax rates, tax credits, uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances and differences', 'between tax laws and accounting laws. The effective tax rate in any financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the blend and/or level of earnings by individual taxing\\njurisdictions.\\nIf the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, presuming an examination by a taxing authority', 'with full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company recognizes all or a portion of the benefit. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that the Company’s\\ndeferred tax assets will not be realized based on all available evidence.\\nThe Company uses judgments and estimates in evaluating its tax positions. The Company’s tax returns are subject to examination by U.S. Federal, state and local and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The', 'Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years. The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax\\npositions only if based on the technical merits of the position it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit. The Company adjusts these tax liabilities, including related', 'interest and penalties, based on the current facts and circumstances. The Company reports tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\\n43\\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\\nThe assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that use their local currency as their functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars (“USD”) using the exchange rate prevailing at', 'each balance sheet date, with balance sheet currency translation adjustments recorded in AOCIL in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company converts foreign currency transactions recognized\\nin the Consolidated Statements of Operations to USD by applying the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the', 'effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities are recorded in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\\nIn 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial', 'Reporting.” The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are\\nmet. The ASU applies only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate', 'reform. In 2021, the FASB expanded the scope of the guidance to include derivatives. On March 9, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to its revolving credit facility replacing\\nLIBOR-based benchmark rates with SOFR-based benchmark rates and other conforming changes (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Company has transitioned its existing contracts to a', 'replacement index. ASU 2020-04 and its amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable', 'Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis.
